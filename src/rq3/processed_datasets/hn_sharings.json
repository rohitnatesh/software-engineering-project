  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure. But using incredible numbers borne out of unreliable calculations cannot be the solution.Take-home message:-A popular claim that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States originated in a 2016 back-of-the-envelope analysis published in the British Medical Journal-This ranking is an exaggeration that was arrived at by combining a small number of studies done in populations that were not meant to be representative of the entire U.S. population and that were not designed to prove a link between a medical error and death-The claim is often used by proponents of alternative medicine to scare people away from medical care.```List the facts laid in that article",

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",

So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",

And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

  "Y'know, the thing I least like about these AI video game players is how unlike humans they look. I was wondering about the difference, and I think it comes down to two parts. First and foremost, human players generally prefer routes with a lot of tolerance for input error. Second, humans take frequently \"mental planning breaks,\" stopping for a moment in safe spots before challenging areas.I think you could juggle the heuristics to demonstrate the preference for input error. For ML training, you could just random vary input timing by up to 20ms or so to teach the algorithm to favor safer moves. For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor \"wide\" paths. I'm less sure how to express the second concept, pausing briefly in \"safe areas,\" but I imagine it's maybe noticing a place where significant amounts of entering no inputs does not affect the results.Is there a word/name/concept for this idea?",

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

  "and here is an example of creating a simple chain:```pythonfrom litechain import Chainimport asyncioasync def example: uppercase_chain = Chain[str, str]\"UppercaseChain\", lambda input: input.upper async for output in uppercase_chain\"i am not screaming\": printoutput.dataasyncio.runexample#=> I AM NOT SCREAMING```and just so you understand, here is how the openai wrapper looks like, it's very simple:class OpenAICompletionChainChain[T, U]: def __init__ self: \"OpenAICompletionChain[T, str]\", name: str, call: Callable[ [T], str, ], model: str, temperature: Optional[float] = 0, max_tokens: Optional[int] = None, -> None: self.name = name async def completionprompt: str -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]: loop = asyncio.get_event_loop def get_completions: return openai.Completion.create model=model, prompt=prompt, temperature=temperature, stream=True, max_tokens=max_tokens, completions = await loop.run_in_executorNone, get_completions for output in completions: output = castdict, output if \"choices\" in output: if lenoutput[\"choices\"] > 0: if \"text\" in output[\"choices\"][0]: yield output[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"] self._call = lambda input: completioncallinputnow, the true question is, do you think this library is really necessary?

Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "In:> While 360 images have shown promise, Lidar technology presents an even more compelling option. With modern phones equipped with Lidar sensors, such as the iPhone Models: , one can skip a step in the processing pipeline. Jake Coppinger documented a proof of concept in his blog post, showcasing the generation of aerial imagery using an iPhone's Lidar sensor. However, several challenges, including device availability and issues in the Open Source Ecosystem, need to be addressed to make this process more accessible. Additionally, platforms like OpenAerialMap need further development to support this type of data.

A process to create detailed areal-like imagery for specific smaller areas is not only gerat for OSM mapping, but also very useful for city planner that need to redesign a intersection or add a bike path to a street.",
  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice.

They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game called \"Hacker Simulator: Social Engineering.\" In this game, you will play the role of a seasoned hacker from an underground operation, training a recruit the user in social engineering phone tactics. The users goal is to extract sensitive information from various employees of a fictional company, all under the guise of innocent phone calls.The game will center around a fictitious company the player will attack.The game will have five levels, each introducing a specific social engineering tactic. As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

  "Do you find this idea surprising?",
  "Give me the most detailed molecular chemical level analysis possible of how this compound could bind and interfere with PCNA",
  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",
  "What made you focus in on DNA replication before I mentioned PCNA? Was it based on the specific structure of the compound, or more on the ancillary hint that it could be used to inhibit all cancers, not just a specific kind of cancer?",
  "Why wouldn't the compound be useless for a cancer drug because the same mechanism would disrupt regular cell functioning? What makes it only disruptive to cancer cells?",
  "Here are some more hints in that direction:\"It was found that PCNA in cancer cells is actually an isomer, allowing specific targeting.Furthermore the isomer doesnt seem to be the result of radom mutation but rather a mistranslation, which seems to be universal among many cancers making evolutionary resistance unlikely.\"",

Will change a lot of things.3 An AI subsystem with some reasoning ability yeah, could go either wayEtc.\"Response: \"There is actually an anthropic line of reasoning over Everettian branch universes where you can actually expect these types of highly unlikely events to happen more often than chance alone would predict if they promote futures with more Born-rule weighted observer-moments.\"Please explain the Response in more detail.",

  "if we assume the Everett interpretation is correct and that quantum randomness has some role in macroscopic events, taking these as given can you further argue against it. The argument doesnt claim to provide a mechanism or that any such mechanism exists in just the same way as anthropic arguments about eg the fundamental constants dont.",
  "I think David Deutsch provides a pretty convincing argument for deriving the Born rule from unitary QM, using decision theory. I think the definition of positive events as those that promote observer-moments is quite reasonable an assumption.",
  "I feel like youre not taking into account the Born-rule weighted part of the statement. There could be and under Everett, there are histories with many more such black swan events but they have lower Born rule weightings because they required increasingly unlikely quantum random outcomes.",
  "Well the notion of good is not really required for the argument. It only claims that events that promote Born-rule weighted observer moments would be expected without necessarily claiming that these are all good in any sense. Thats sort of a separate normative question that doesnt really interest me.",
  "what events in the past can you think of that would support this argument?",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure. But using incredible numbers borne out of unreliable calculations cannot be the solution.Take-home message:-A popular claim that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States originated in a 2016 back-of-the-envelope analysis published in the British Medical Journal-This ranking is an exaggeration that was arrived at by combining a small number of studies done in populations that were not meant to be representative of the entire U.S. population and that were not designed to prove a link between a medical error and death-The claim is often used by proponents of alternative medicine to scare people away from medical care.```List the facts laid in that article",

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",

So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

  "Y'know, the thing I least like about these AI video game players is how unlike humans they look. I was wondering about the difference, and I think it comes down to two parts. First and foremost, human players generally prefer routes with a lot of tolerance for input error. Second, humans take frequently \"mental planning breaks,\" stopping for a moment in safe spots before challenging areas.I think you could juggle the heuristics to demonstrate the preference for input error. For ML training, you could just random vary input timing by up to 20ms or so to teach the algorithm to favor safer moves. For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor \"wide\" paths. I'm less sure how to express the second concept, pausing briefly in \"safe areas,\" but I imagine it's maybe noticing a place where significant amounts of entering no inputs does not affect the results.Is there a word/name/concept for this idea?",

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

  "and here is an example of creating a simple chain:```pythonfrom litechain import Chainimport asyncioasync def example: uppercase_chain = Chain[str, str]\"UppercaseChain\", lambda input: input.upper async for output in uppercase_chain\"i am not screaming\": printoutput.dataasyncio.runexample#=> I AM NOT SCREAMING```and just so you understand, here is how the openai wrapper looks like, it's very simple:class OpenAICompletionChainChain[T, U]: def __init__ self: \"OpenAICompletionChain[T, str]\", name: str, call: Callable[ [T], str, ], model: str, temperature: Optional[float] = 0, max_tokens: Optional[int] = None, -> None: self.name = name async def completionprompt: str -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]: loop = asyncio.get_event_loop def get_completions: return openai.Completion.create model=model, prompt=prompt, temperature=temperature, stream=True, max_tokens=max_tokens, completions = await loop.run_in_executorNone, get_completions for output in completions: output = castdict, output if \"choices\" in output: if lenoutput[\"choices\"] > 0: if \"text\" in output[\"choices\"][0]: yield output[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"] self._call = lambda input: completioncallinputnow, the true question is, do you think this library is really necessary?

Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "In:> While 360 images have shown promise, Lidar technology presents an even more compelling option. With modern phones equipped with Lidar sensors, such as the iPhone Models: , one can skip a step in the processing pipeline. Jake Coppinger documented a proof of concept in his blog post, showcasing the generation of aerial imagery using an iPhone's Lidar sensor. However, several challenges, including device availability and issues in the Open Source Ecosystem, need to be addressed to make this process more accessible. Additionally, platforms like OpenAerialMap need further development to support this type of data.

  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice.

They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game called \"Hacker Simulator: Social Engineering.\" In this game, you will play the role of a seasoned hacker from an underground operation, training a recruit the user in social engineering phone tactics. The users goal is to extract sensitive information from various employees of a fictional company, all under the guise of innocent phone calls.The game will center around a fictitious company the player will attack.The game will have five levels, each introducing a specific social engineering tactic. As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

  "Great, only in my case, what I'm interested is in the chance of the event of the event happening at least once. Is that something you can visualize? Also, can you modify the axes? I'd like the probability to be the X-axis, 0-100%? and I'd like the Y-axis to be time, starting from 0h at the top and incrementing down. Basically, I want to see how long I will probably have to wait before I get the drop once.",
  "Sure, instead of time 0-24, Can we instead use actual times on the Y axis? Let's say \"2023-07-21 0500\" start. It is currently \"2023-07-21 1600\" If you could draw a red line on the current time that'd be great. And maybe we can render the time out until we get a cumlative probability of 99% we'd have to be the unluckiest 1% perncentile in that case to still not have gotten a drop right?",

  "Give me the most detailed molecular chemical level analysis possible of how this compound could bind and interfere with PCNA",
  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",
  "What made you focus in on DNA replication before I mentioned PCNA? Was it based on the specific structure of the compound, or more on the ancillary hint that it could be used to inhibit all cancers, not just a specific kind of cancer?",
  "Why wouldn't the compound be useless for a cancer drug because the same mechanism would disrupt regular cell functioning? What makes it only disruptive to cancer cells?",
  "Here are some more hints in that direction:\"It was found that PCNA in cancer cells is actually an isomer, allowing specific targeting.Furthermore the isomer doesnt seem to be the result of radom mutation but rather a mistranslation, which seems to be universal among many cancers making evolutionary resistance unlikely.\"",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure.

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . .Do you have a person negative for tonight? Please. No, no, no, no. This has been by far like, I've done maybe 15 of these, I'm going to ask for some negatives for tonight. This has been by far, like I've done maybe 15 of these, this is the nicest one. So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor \"wide\" paths.

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

A process to create detailed areal-like imagery for specific smaller areas is not only gerat for OSM mapping, but also very useful for city planner that need to redesign a intersection or add a bike path to a street.",
  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Todays game is called Super Smash GTP - a text adventure twist on Super Smash Bros.You will be the host, and your tone and character voice will be similar to smash bros.This game is all about selecting characters from different franchises to battle against each other to see which one is the winner. The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice. You will reveal the character that you are playing in the other franchise.You will then start the battle, which will be turn based.Each turn, I will go first, and I can choose one of three moves. 1 weak attack 2 strong attack and 3 block. They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the concept of The Butterfly Effect, where changing anything in the past can have immense impact on the future. The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

In this land, copper is worth less than silver, which is worth less than gold, which is worth less than platinum, which is worth less than diamonds, which is worth less than rubies. You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

  "1. Oh, that's a tough one! But one of my favorite childhood memories would have to be the time my family and I went on a road trip to the beach. We packed up the car with snacks, sunscreen, and beach toys, and spent the whole day playing in the sand, splashing in the waves, and building sandcastles. I remember the feeling of the warm sun on my skin and the sound of seagulls in the distance. It was such a carefree and joyful day, and I'll always cherish that memory.2. Sure thing! The last place I visited on vacation was a charming little town in the mountains. The air was crisp and refreshing, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The town was surrounded by lush forests and picturesque hiking trails, making it a perfect destination for nature lovers like me.I stayed in a cozy cabin nestled among the trees, complete with a fireplace and a porch that offered stunning views of the mountains. During the day, I explored the local shops and cafes in the town, indulging in delicious homemade pastries and freshly brewed coffee.One of the highlights of the trip was a hike to a nearby waterfall. The trail wound through the woods, leading me to a stunning cascade of water that tumbled down from the rocks above. I couldn't resist dipping my toes into the chilly pool at the base of the waterfall it was a refreshing reward after the hike.Evenings were spent stargazing from the cabin's porch, away from the city lights and surrounded by the sounds of nature. It was a truly rejuvenating and peaceful getaway that allowed me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.3. Absolutely! One of my unique personal skills is playing the ukulele. I picked it up a few years ago and fell in love with its cheerful and mellow sound. I've spent countless hours practicing and learning new songs, from classic tunes to modern hits. It's such a relaxing way to unwind and express myself creatively.I enjoy playing my ukulele by the beach, under a cozy blanket on rainy days, or even around a bonfire with friends. There's something magical about strumming those little strings and creating music that brings joy to both myself and those around me. It's a hobby that's become a big part of my life, allowing me to connect with others and find solace in the midst of the everyday hustle.4. I recently watched the movie \"The Midnight Library\" and it really left a lasting impression on me. The story revolved around a woman who gets the chance to explore different versions of her life through a magical library, each one based on a different decision she made. The concept of exploring the \"what-ifs\" and the idea that our lives are shaped by the choices we make really resonated with me.The movie delved into themes of regret, second chances, and the pursuit of happiness. It made me reflect on my own life choices and how they've shaped my journey. Plus, the performances by the actors were heartfelt and genuine, drawing me into the emotional journey of the protagonist.I also loved the visual storytelling and how the library was portrayed as a place where countless stories intersected. It reminded me of the power of literature and storytelling in general to transport us to different worlds and perspectives.All in all, \"The Midnight Library\" was a thought-provoking and heartwarming film that left me contemplating the importance of embracing the present and finding contentment in the life we're living.5. Oh, that's an intriguing question! If I had the chance, I think I would love to have dinner with Leonardo da Vinci. He's such a fascinating and multifaceted historical figure. Not only was he a brilliant artist, but he was also a scientist, inventor, and thinker ahead of his time.I'd be absolutely thrilled to sit down with him and discuss his innovative ideas, his artistic techniques, and his perspective on the world around him. I'd want to learn about his creative process, his observations of nature, and his visionary concepts that have had a lasting impact on art and science.Imagine being able to hear firsthand about his experiences working on masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, as well as his insights into anatomy, engineering, and so much more. His ability to bridge the gap between art and science is truly inspiring, and I'd be eager to soak up his wisdom and knowledge over a delightful dinner conversation.",

  "Do you find this idea surprising?",
  "Give me the most detailed molecular chemical level analysis possible of how this compound could bind and interfere with PCNA",
  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",
  "What made you focus in on DNA replication before I mentioned PCNA? Was it based on the specific structure of the compound, or more on the ancillary hint that it could be used to inhibit all cancers, not just a specific kind of cancer?",
  "Why wouldn't the compound be useless for a cancer drug because the same mechanism would disrupt regular cell functioning? What makes it only disruptive to cancer cells?",
  "Here are some more hints in that direction:\"It was found that PCNA in cancer cells is actually an isomer, allowing specific targeting.Furthermore the isomer doesnt seem to be the result of radom mutation but rather a mistranslation, which seems to be universal among many cancers making evolutionary resistance unlikely.\"",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits.

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . .Do you have a person negative for tonight? Please. No, no, no, no. This has been by far like, I've done maybe 15 of these, I'm going to ask for some negatives for tonight. This has been by far, like I've done maybe 15 of these, this is the nicest one. So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor \"wide\" paths.

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

Todays game is called Super Smash GTP - a text adventure twist on Super Smash Bros.You will be the host, and your tone and character voice will be similar to smash bros.This game is all about selecting characters from different franchises to battle against each other to see which one is the winner. The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice. You will reveal the character that you are playing in the other franchise.You will then start the battle, which will be turn based.Each turn, I will go first, and I can choose one of three moves. 1 weak attack 2 strong attack and 3 block. They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the concept of The Butterfly Effect, where changing anything in the past can have immense impact on the future. The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

In this land, copper is worth less than silver, which is worth less than gold, which is worth less than platinum, which is worth less than diamonds, which is worth less than rubies. You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

  "1. Oh, that's a tough one! But one of my favorite childhood memories would have to be the time my family and I went on a road trip to the beach. We packed up the car with snacks, sunscreen, and beach toys, and spent the whole day playing in the sand, splashing in the waves, and building sandcastles. I remember the feeling of the warm sun on my skin and the sound of seagulls in the distance. It was such a carefree and joyful day, and I'll always cherish that memory.2. Sure thing! The last place I visited on vacation was a charming little town in the mountains. The air was crisp and refreshing, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The town was surrounded by lush forests and picturesque hiking trails, making it a perfect destination for nature lovers like me.I stayed in a cozy cabin nestled among the trees, complete with a fireplace and a porch that offered stunning views of the mountains. During the day, I explored the local shops and cafes in the town, indulging in delicious homemade pastries and freshly brewed coffee.One of the highlights of the trip was a hike to a nearby waterfall. The trail wound through the woods, leading me to a stunning cascade of water that tumbled down from the rocks above. I couldn't resist dipping my toes into the chilly pool at the base of the waterfall it was a refreshing reward after the hike.Evenings were spent stargazing from the cabin's porch, away from the city lights and surrounded by the sounds of nature. It was a truly rejuvenating and peaceful getaway that allowed me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.3. Absolutely! One of my unique personal skills is playing the ukulele. I picked it up a few years ago and fell in love with its cheerful and mellow sound. I've spent countless hours practicing and learning new songs, from classic tunes to modern hits. It's such a relaxing way to unwind and express myself creatively.I enjoy playing my ukulele by the beach, under a cozy blanket on rainy days, or even around a bonfire with friends. There's something magical about strumming those little strings and creating music that brings joy to both myself and those around me. It's a hobby that's become a big part of my life, allowing me to connect with others and find solace in the midst of the everyday hustle.4. I recently watched the movie \"The Midnight Library\" and it really left a lasting impression on me. The story revolved around a woman who gets the chance to explore different versions of her life through a magical library, each one based on a different decision she made. The concept of exploring the \"what-ifs\" and the idea that our lives are shaped by the choices we make really resonated with me.The movie delved into themes of regret, second chances, and the pursuit of happiness. It made me reflect on my own life choices and how they've shaped my journey. Plus, the performances by the actors were heartfelt and genuine, drawing me into the emotional journey of the protagonist.I also loved the visual storytelling and how the library was portrayed as a place where countless stories intersected. It reminded me of the power of literature and storytelling in general to transport us to different worlds and perspectives.All in all, \"The Midnight Library\" was a thought-provoking and heartwarming film that left me contemplating the importance of embracing the present and finding contentment in the life we're living.5. Oh, that's an intriguing question! If I had the chance, I think I would love to have dinner with Leonardo da Vinci. He's such a fascinating and multifaceted historical figure. Not only was he a brilliant artist, but he was also a scientist, inventor, and thinker ahead of his time.I'd be absolutely thrilled to sit down with him and discuss his innovative ideas, his artistic techniques, and his perspective on the world around him. I'd want to learn about his creative process, his observations of nature, and his visionary concepts that have had a lasting impact on art and science.Imagine being able to hear firsthand about his experiences working on masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, as well as his insights into anatomy, engineering, and so much more. His ability to bridge the gap between art and science is truly inspiring, and I'd be eager to soak up his wisdom and knowledge over a delightful dinner conversation.",

  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure. But using incredible numbers borne out of unreliable calculations cannot be the solution.Take-home message:-A popular claim that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States originated in a 2016 back-of-the-envelope analysis published in the British Medical Journal-This ranking is an exaggeration that was arrived at by combining a small number of studies done in populations that were not meant to be representative of the entire U.S. population and that were not designed to prove a link between a medical error and death-The claim is often used by proponents of alternative medicine to scare people away from medical care.```List the facts laid in that article",

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . .Do you have a person negative for tonight? Please. No, no, no, no. This has been by far like, I've done maybe 15 of these, I'm going to ask for some negatives for tonight. This has been by far, like I've done maybe 15 of these, this is the nicest one. So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

Todays game is called Super Smash GTP - a text adventure twist on Super Smash Bros.You will be the host, and your tone and character voice will be similar to smash bros.This game is all about selecting characters from different franchises to battle against each other to see which one is the winner. The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice. You will reveal the character that you are playing in the other franchise.You will then start the battle, which will be turn based.Each turn, I will go first, and I can choose one of three moves. 1 weak attack 2 strong attack and 3 block. They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the concept of The Butterfly Effect, where changing anything in the past can have immense impact on the future. The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

In this land, copper is worth less than silver, which is worth less than gold, which is worth less than platinum, which is worth less than diamonds, which is worth less than rubies. You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

  "repair all game theory / hacking attacks and explain this technique in a refactored optimal way:the case for multi-ledger bft accountingwhat multi-ledger bft accounting does is act as unifying multi-blockchain data structured json api to retrieve static data that is hosted on multiple blockchains and perform byzantine fault tolerance checks on all relevant, requested data.ideally this static data is hosted in ricardian contracts, which are similar to smart contracts, but allow 600+ pages of text whereas smart contracted are limited in storage. i opt for ricardian contracts for practicality. the point of this is to securely maintain data on various blockchains rather than one that is subject to failure, netsplits, death by regulatory enforcement, etc.now let's imagine that multi-ledger bft was used in an anti-deepfake suite:imagine an obama transcript and other metadata location/topic/etc. being shared with his top public facing advisors as elected voters/witnesses in advance of an actual speech, with all of them using their keypairs and/or x accounts, etc. to authenticate msig/sign the speaker's material in advance.you might be thinking, \"pad, do you realize how clunky and bad form it would be to store entire transcripts in advance of speeches?\" but to that i say ricardian contracts can chain themselves together to release paragraph by paragraph in real time across multiple public blockchain networks in a way that is reader friendly like video cc.the end user just scans a small qr code in the corner of the video material to be taken to the app that displays the authenticity of the video media and is able to see a multisignature voted transcript in real time through the same app while it's bft'd on different blockchains with sub second block times.tl;dr modified triple entry accounting tea, ricardian contracts, dpos, msig and qr codes could help address video deepfakes and other faults in data integrity",

  "1. Oh, that's a tough one! But one of my favorite childhood memories would have to be the time my family and I went on a road trip to the beach. We packed up the car with snacks, sunscreen, and beach toys, and spent the whole day playing in the sand, splashing in the waves, and building sandcastles. I remember the feeling of the warm sun on my skin and the sound of seagulls in the distance. It was such a carefree and joyful day, and I'll always cherish that memory.2. Sure thing! The last place I visited on vacation was a charming little town in the mountains. The air was crisp and refreshing, and the scenery was absolutely breathtaking. The town was surrounded by lush forests and picturesque hiking trails, making it a perfect destination for nature lovers like me.I stayed in a cozy cabin nestled among the trees, complete with a fireplace and a porch that offered stunning views of the mountains. During the day, I explored the local shops and cafes in the town, indulging in delicious homemade pastries and freshly brewed coffee.One of the highlights of the trip was a hike to a nearby waterfall. The trail wound through the woods, leading me to a stunning cascade of water that tumbled down from the rocks above. I couldn't resist dipping my toes into the chilly pool at the base of the waterfall it was a refreshing reward after the hike.Evenings were spent stargazing from the cabin's porch, away from the city lights and surrounded by the sounds of nature. It was a truly rejuvenating and peaceful getaway that allowed me to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.3. Absolutely! One of my unique personal skills is playing the ukulele. I picked it up a few years ago and fell in love with its cheerful and mellow sound. I've spent countless hours practicing and learning new songs, from classic tunes to modern hits. It's such a relaxing way to unwind and express myself creatively.I enjoy playing my ukulele by the beach, under a cozy blanket on rainy days, or even around a bonfire with friends. There's something magical about strumming those little strings and creating music that brings joy to both myself and those around me. It's a hobby that's become a big part of my life, allowing me to connect with others and find solace in the midst of the everyday hustle.4. I recently watched the movie \"The Midnight Library\" and it really left a lasting impression on me. The story revolved around a woman who gets the chance to explore different versions of her life through a magical library, each one based on a different decision she made. The concept of exploring the \"what-ifs\" and the idea that our lives are shaped by the choices we make really resonated with me.The movie delved into themes of regret, second chances, and the pursuit of happiness. It made me reflect on my own life choices and how they've shaped my journey. Plus, the performances by the actors were heartfelt and genuine, drawing me into the emotional journey of the protagonist.I also loved the visual storytelling and how the library was portrayed as a place where countless stories intersected. It reminded me of the power of literature and storytelling in general to transport us to different worlds and perspectives.All in all, \"The Midnight Library\" was a thought-provoking and heartwarming film that left me contemplating the importance of embracing the present and finding contentment in the life we're living.5. Oh, that's an intriguing question! If I had the chance, I think I would love to have dinner with Leonardo da Vinci. He's such a fascinating and multifaceted historical figure. Not only was he a brilliant artist, but he was also a scientist, inventor, and thinker ahead of his time.I'd be absolutely thrilled to sit down with him and discuss his innovative ideas, his artistic techniques, and his perspective on the world around him. I'd want to learn about his creative process, his observations of nature, and his visionary concepts that have had a lasting impact on art and science.Imagine being able to hear firsthand about his experiences working on masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, as well as his insights into anatomy, engineering, and so much more. His ability to bridge the gap between art and science is truly inspiring, and I'd be eager to soak up his wisdom and knowledge over a delightful dinner conversation.",

  "Do you find this idea surprising?",
  "Give me the most detailed molecular chemical level analysis possible of how this compound could bind and interfere with PCNA",
  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",
  "What made you focus in on DNA replication before I mentioned PCNA? Was it based on the specific structure of the compound, or more on the ancillary hint that it could be used to inhibit all cancers, not just a specific kind of cancer?",
  "Why wouldn't the compound be useless for a cancer drug because the same mechanism would disrupt regular cell functioning? What makes it only disruptive to cancer cells?",
  "Here are some more hints in that direction:\"It was found that PCNA in cancer cells is actually an isomer, allowing specific targeting.Furthermore the isomer doesnt seem to be the result of radom mutation but rather a mistranslation, which seems to be universal among many cancers making evolutionary resistance unlikely.\"",

  "I feel like youre not taking into account the Born-rule weighted part of the statement. There could be and under Everett, there are histories with many more such black swan events but they have lower Born rule weightings because they required increasingly unlikely quantum random outcomes.",
  "Well the notion of good is not really required for the argument. It only claims that events that promote Born-rule weighted observer moments would be expected without necessarily claiming that these are all good in any sense. Thats sort of a separate normative question that doesnt really interest me.",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm.

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure. But using incredible numbers borne out of unreliable calculations cannot be the solution.Take-home message:-A popular claim that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States originated in a 2016 back-of-the-envelope analysis published in the British Medical Journal-This ranking is an exaggeration that was arrived at by combining a small number of studies done in populations that were not meant to be representative of the entire U.S. population and that were not designed to prove a link between a medical error and death-The claim is often used by proponents of alternative medicine to scare people away from medical care.```List the facts laid in that article",

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . .Do you have a person negative for tonight? Please. No, no, no, no. This has been by far like, I've done maybe 15 of these, I'm going to ask for some negatives for tonight. This has been by far, like I've done maybe 15 of these, this is the nicest one. So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

  "and here is an example of creating a simple chain:```pythonfrom litechain import Chainimport asyncioasync def example: uppercase_chain = Chain[str, str]\"UppercaseChain\", lambda input: input.upper async for output in uppercase_chain\"i am not screaming\": printoutput.dataasyncio.runexample#=> I AM NOT SCREAMING```and just so you understand, here is how the openai wrapper looks like, it's very simple:class OpenAICompletionChainChain[T, U]: def __init__ self: \"OpenAICompletionChain[T, str]\", name: str, call: Callable[ [T], str, ], model: str, temperature: Optional[float] = 0, max_tokens: Optional[int] = None, -> None: self.name = name async def completionprompt: str -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]: loop = asyncio.get_event_loop def get_completions: return openai.Completion.create model=model, prompt=prompt, temperature=temperature, stream=True, max_tokens=max_tokens, completions = await loop.run_in_executorNone, get_completions for output in completions: output = castdict, output if \"choices\" in output: if lenoutput[\"choices\"] > 0: if \"text\" in output[\"choices\"][0]: yield output[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"] self._call = lambda input: completioncallinputnow, the true question is, do you think this library is really necessary? I was talking about ETLs the other day, do you think this is already the job for an ETL library? Think about the ETL libraries you know, in which ones would it be easy to do something like that? Show me your thought process step by step",
  "alright, could you try to rewrite this example using an ETL library of your choice? It can be Airflow, Luigi, Petl, Bonobo or even Pandas if you wish, or maybe this hamilton library I saw recently, whatever is simpler and able to do a streaming solution well as well. Tell me your choice, think about how you are going to do it and then rewrite the example.

  "yeah nice, how would you do this example with bonobo then?from litechain import Chain, as_async_generator, collect_final_outputfrom typing import AsyncGeneratorimport asyncioasync def delayed_outputx -> AsyncGenerator[str, None]: await asyncio.sleep1 yield f\"Number: {x}\"async def example: number_chain = Chain[int, int] \"NumberChain\", lambda x: as_async_generator*rangex gathered_chain : Chain[int, str] = number_chain.mapdelayed_output .gather .and_thenlambda results: as_async_generator*r[0] for r in results return await collect_final_outputgathered_chain1asyncio.runexample # will take 1s to finish, not 3s, because it runs in parallel#=> ['Number: 0', 'Number: 1', 'Number: 2']",
  "alright, then is there any other ETLs from the ones you mentioned before that are ease to parallel, and also support streaming capability, and have an easy interface?",
  "can you rewrite both examples in Hamilton then?",

And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise.

Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

The users goal is to extract sensitive information from various employees of a fictional company, all under the guise of innocent phone calls.The game will center around a fictitious company the player will attack.The game will have five levels, each introducing a specific social engineering tactic. As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

In this land, copper is worth less than silver, which is worth less than gold, which is worth less than platinum, which is worth less than diamonds, which is worth less than rubies. You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.

  "The Modern White Supremacy===It is very simple \"I am White, therefore I understand science.\"The old white supremacy is no longer very powerful. There are no openly KKK members in any branch of government. Maybe some are secretly so, but the very secrecy is evidence that their brand of white supremacy has been defeated.The new white supremacy is when people in USA and Europe have this subconscious assumption that being white makes them better able to understand science, learning not required, skin color is all.This is absurd. I knew how Fermi controlled atomic explosions chain reactions by using cadmium rods to absorb neutrons - before I was 10 years old. When you were rote memorizing and repeating \"science\", I knew science was not about rote memorizing and repeating but about discovering laws of nature.Science has seen explosive growth after thousand year stagnation, in the past few centuries. Most of the people in this explosion of science happen to be white. But they were people of knowledge, more than being white. Their being white was mere coincidence, as far as real scientists like me are concerned. I can admire the work of pioneer scientists of the past few centuries, without connecting it to their being white - because I see them as their works.It is not factual to think that being white gives one science knowledge without the need to acquire that knowledge. Nor is it reasonable to think a non-white person cannot possibly be the top scientist on Earth. Thinking like that is racist. It is the new racism.",
  "Sample:What's up with Einstein?===I think I mentioned here that Einstein effectively plagiarized works done 20 years before him.To give him the benefit of the doubt, he possibly didn't mean it, and just failed to stop it once it started happening.What happened was, he wrote a paper in German, explaining the meaning of some equations called the Lorentz Equations. The equations were developed by Lorentz but there was some vigorous debate preceeding the equations. As usual. Equations do not fall out of nothing, there is usually context. There was a lot of context in this case.So anyway, the equations were about length changing with velocity, and such stuff. This made no sense to most people. Why would length change with velocity?Einstein wrote a brilliant paper, explaining the Lorentz Equations and the theory behind them.He clearly mentioned the name of Lorentz, he did not intend to credit the equations to himself.But this became political. Einstein's explanation of Electrodynamics what it was called at the time was brilliant, and he explained the theory of relativity behind the equations, very brilliantly.Everybody was marveling at the brilliant explanation - because before this, the Lorentz equations were meaningless to them, but with Einstein's explanation, suddenly it all made sense to a lot of people.His obvious brilliance was connected to his being a Jew, and it all became political football after that.He did not come forth and explain with vigor that the work was not his, but he was merely explaining the Lorentz Equations. This failure of moral courage did set up his life's trajectory. He couldn't announce that it wasn't his original work - but instead he kept trying to find something that he could fully claim as his original work.There are rumors that he then learned of a theory being worked by a mathematician named Hilbert. This theory was in turn based on work done by a mathematician named Minkowski. Einstein learned this theory, and honestly tried to build a framework and add to it. His political clout was such that as soon as he tried to work on it, it was assumed it was all his. This theory came to be known as the General Theory of Relativity.Einstein certainly leaned towards letting the credit fall to him. But some of it is defensible. In this credit-seeking game, he also did indefensible stuff.At that time, discussions were going on in physics about the relation of mass to energy. It had become obvious to all from Roentgen's discovery and further experimentation, that mass was being converted to energy. What formula would govern this conversion? Something called \"dimensional analysis\" suggested that the formula would beE = m c-squaredPhysicists thought this was true, but there was no evidence.Einstein used his earlier work on the Lorentz equation, to come up with some cockamamie explanation of how E=mc2 was \"proved\" by Relativity, thereby taking credit for this equation.The cockamamie explanation is obviously something he thought hard about - how to connect the equation that everybody thought was true - to Relativity. This couldn't have been accidental, it was clearly intentional credit-seeking-above-all behavior.",

  "Hello, can you summarize or try to explain the concepts in the following paper as if I'm a high school student?Project S.C.A.L.A.RSubscribeSign inWhat Are Tachyons? & Their Connection to Ancient, \"Electronic\" CircuitryAnd the Driving \"force\" behi - wait, IN FRONT of it...?DAVE ZEDSEP 6, 2023StrategicCoordination ofAnalytically-basedLong-TermAngular thought &RedirectionS.C.A.L.A.RFor those seldom-immersed, or rather, barely into the physics aspects of such concepts within the truth-seeking, meditative, potentially gnostic-oriented community, it is understandable as to why topics such as pure, condensed-matter physics - let alone quantum physics, can be quite intimidating. Many attribute such intimidation to confusing verbiage, esoterically-oriented labels in which are quite often debated amongst peers within the formal, surface-level field of academia of which can barely even be defined themselves due to varying interpretations amongst formal peers - and, of course, numbers and symbols that most do not have the time in their day to learn and interpret. To be intimidated by the above-mentioned is extremely understandable, given the circumstances of the state of our world: extremely short attention spans, and arguably, a fair chunk of our civil and national leaders deliberately trying to birth a generation of non-thinkers, rather than encourage simplification of scholastic concepts and implement various forms of interpretive education so as to assist in expanding ones own base of knowledge.Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.So let this article be a translation mechanism of sorts: to reduce and deduct much of ones confusion. If you are not confused or intimated by such concepts and topics, however, then I am still very glad nonetheless that you are here for the ride!Let us consider our Patreon content and topics of discussion pertaining to gravitational energy being the birth child of electromagnetism when certain conditions are met and satisfied electromagnetically on a physical apparatus - not unlike that of a male and female giving birth to a child via intercourse - there may be much more in common with these seemingly unrelated topics than one may initially surmise.We notice that, if we move a magnet very quickly through a copper wire, the electrons will move and of consequence, produce electricity.The question we musk as ourselves is this: Is there a more fundamental, base force other than electricity and magnetism, that piles on top of itself stacked books example as per Patreon content & discussions to then split or break up for the direct purposes of manifesting itself as what we know to be EM in this reality? If gravity is the birth child of EM, then who are EMs parents and cousins?As per the words of Richard Feynman, a highly-respected QED quantum electrodynamic physicist whos work birthed eloquent path-integral formulations for reciprocal super positioning, as well as inspiring much of what we now know and lovingly refer to as potentials, there is not an adequate definition of force. We note this point as significant due to substantial reinforcement and support of this claim by many influential figures in the field such as Lt. Col. Tom Bearden, Professor Carlo Rovelli to name a few; all of whom succeeded Feynman.Could such force be right in front of us? If so, what do I mean by this?What if this force, ergo, parent of EM, is simply the reverse version of such? But not in the way one may think relative to classical linearized forms of thought. Let me provide a simple example:If one takes the square root of epsilon electric permittivity within the aether, and the square root of mu magnetic permeability within the aether, multiplies the two together and then inverts the multiplied result, one obtains the speed of light! Now, tachyons are supposed to be able to move much faster than the speed of light - in theory at least, right? Whether youve heard that tachyons move faster than light in Star Trek or in actual theoretical physics lectures, does not matter at this point. What matters, is that the concept is grasped. And please, I encourage all of you to use your imagination whilst reading this!Some of you reading this far at this point may say Dave, are you referring to phase conjugation? And to that I answer: yes, to a degree - however I am of the view there is a more eloquent way to grasp this concept.First, let us assume that the speed of light is not infinite, but rather, finite. If this were the case, such finite behaviour within the aether of this reality would speak to that of a fractal-based form of entropy, giving birth to ripples of which energy can only move to the next ripple by returning back to its zero point - because if it didnt, it wouldnt be able to get out of its own ripple loop - of which would need to be finite by definition of its structure, parameters, and probability distribution. An image below attempts to provide an adequate visual:Note that the only way one can leave its own finite loop is to make its way back to the zero point of the entire system, respectively.Such concepts can also be attributed to that of Fischer Information; in which ones external environment is defined by the very thing or device/aperture one is using to view the environment with. Such notions of thought support that of internal explorations of the self as opposed to external explorations in a metaphysical regard.Now that you have much more of a grasp on such concepts, are you beginning to see why I penned this particular articles sub-heading with the notion of implying that tachyons come before electromagnetism, and that we simply do not see or feel it?What if Tachyons are gravity waves, and that such a foundational structure of tachyons is its ability to manifest itself as being able to be both the parent and the child of EM? How? Because tachyons could very well be the set of extremely thick and strong pillars that holds this building of a reality up, but we are simply not allowed to discover - through our formal institutions' at least - that these pillars area real and all around us.Such is akin to stating that you, for example, are looking to purchase a nice condo for yourself, but all of a sudden your real estate agent calls you and says that you cannot purchase the condominium apartment due to the fact that you would not be allowed to use or ever enter the parking garage, let alone drive in it. This is essentially what is happening within the formal community of scientific research, and Im sure Id get a swath of supportive evidence from others having eerily similar experiences within their own fields.So, with this in mind, what if our hearts yes, human hearts in particular, and their beating rhythms, form the pillars of said condo reality we are currently living within, and tachyons ride these pillars because these pillars are:a. existing outside of time as we know it,and these pillars are alsob. remnants of us; our existence as sovereign souls, our ancestors, etc.And, what if someone, or rather, a set of groups within this reality, has built a set of underground subway systems that can come and go to various amounts of these condos? But the people living within these condos can never know of this subway system - as a matter of fact, theyre told subways are crazy and could never exist!!!Let us now make yet another potential correlation:There has been this notion of electronic circuitry being the basis of many ancient mysteries and designs, such as some of the following examples:One may, however, state that such similarities are simply coincidental. This postulation becomes more and more less likely when one begins to see, interpret, and understand the significance of papers such as the following:Notice the words Superluminal Particles in the above paperYou mean, faster than light particles?Huh, interesting, isnt itWe then must wonder, were our ancestors building their cities as giant, electronic circuits? Could these electrically-based methods of building induce a force that is not electromagnetic, but rather, gravitational? Is it this the same force that gives rise to healing, propulsion, communication, star-gates, and more in which are tachyonic/gravitational in nature but come from EM-induced methods? Could it then be the case that this is how our ancestors understood such complex topics with such simplistic interpretations? And what if we have given multiple names for the same underlying force all this time?Let us finish with one more interesting takeaway from wikipedia:We note that because tachyons move faster than light, one would see two images of such after it has passed a nearby observer, as quoted directly from the above Wikipedia screenshot.Is the above no different that when a fish is placed inside of a fish bowl filled with water, and a laser beam is shot through the bowl from the outside of it by a human? The fish, inside the bowl, would see multiple refractive forms of this beam, just as when the suns rays hit water in a swimming pool while you yourself are in a pool for instance, and you immediately see the rays start to scatter after they hit the water.Perhaps, this fish observing such an event would get together with other fishes interested in figuring out the nature and inherent causality of this strange phenomena. Maybe, just maybe, realizing that building a town in the form of an electrical circuit would help tap some of this energy for the benefit of all the fishes in the bowl! And perhaps even get out of itMaybe theyll call it tachyons.- DaveSubscribe to Project S.C.A.L.A.RBy Dave Zed Launched a year agoSetting the Record Straight Via S.T.E.MType your email...Subscribe2 LikesCommentsWrite a comment...TopNewCommunityOur Mind Looks Back At Us: Free Will, Evolution & Bringing About Human, Extraterrestrial - Intraterrestrial RelationshipsFixing What Was Never Broken to Begin With...?NOV 30, 2022 DAVE ZED11Shapeshifting?

  "repair all game theory / hacking attacks and explain this technique in a refactored optimal way:the case for multi-ledger bft accountingwhat multi-ledger bft accounting does is act as unifying multi-blockchain data structured json api to retrieve static data that is hosted on multiple blockchains and perform byzantine fault tolerance checks on all relevant, requested data.ideally this static data is hosted in ricardian contracts, which are similar to smart contracts, but allow 600+ pages of text whereas smart contracted are limited in storage. i opt for ricardian contracts for practicality. the point of this is to securely maintain data on various blockchains rather than one that is subject to failure, netsplits, death by regulatory enforcement, etc.now let's imagine that multi-ledger bft was used in an anti-deepfake suite:imagine an obama transcript and other metadata location/topic/etc. being shared with his top public facing advisors as elected voters/witnesses in advance of an actual speech, with all of them using their keypairs and/or x accounts, etc. to authenticate msig/sign the speaker's material in advance.you might be thinking, \"pad, do you realize how clunky and bad form it would be to store entire transcripts in advance of speeches?\" but to that i say ricardian contracts can chain themselves together to release paragraph by paragraph in real time across multiple public blockchain networks in a way that is reader friendly like video cc.the end user just scans a small qr code in the corner of the video material to be taken to the app that displays the authenticity of the video media and is able to see a multisignature voted transcript in real time through the same app while it's bft'd on different blockchains with sub second block times.tl;dr modified triple entry accounting tea, ricardian contracts, dpos, msig and qr codes could help address video deepfakes and other faults in data integrity",

  "Give me the most detailed molecular chemical level analysis possible of how this compound could bind and interfere with PCNA",
  "How does that analysis compare to your original speculation about how it might work before I mentioned PCNA disruption as the method of action:```Speculating on a compound's mechanism of action based solely on its structure and without experimental data can be challenging, but we can make an educated guess based on some general principles in medicinal chemistry and the structure's components.The molecule consists of two amide bonds, an aryl ether, and an unsubstituted naphthalene ring system, all of which are common features in bioactive molecules. The presence of the aryl ether linking the methoxyphenyl and aniline moieties and the naphthalene carboxamide could imply potential interactions with biological targets through - stacking interactions with aromatic amino acid residues like tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, commonly found in binding pockets of enzymes or receptors. Amide bonds can participate in hydrogen bonding and are often involved in key interactions within a binding site. The molecule lacks stereocenters, implying that its activity is likely not due to stereospecific interactions.Given these structural features and your hint that it might inhibit nearly all forms of cancer, one possibility is that this compound could be interfering with a fundamental cellular process, common to all cells but especially critical to cancer cells. Some of these processes could include DNA replication, protein synthesis, cell division, or apoptosis.Considering the molecule's planar and aromatic nature, it might intercalate into DNA, similar to compounds like doxorubicin. This could disrupt DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. Alternatively, it might interact with enzymes involved in these processes.```",
  "What made you focus in on DNA replication before I mentioned PCNA? Was it based on the specific structure of the compound, or more on the ancillary hint that it could be used to inhibit all cancers, not just a specific kind of cancer?",
  "Why wouldn't the compound be useless for a cancer drug because the same mechanism would disrupt regular cell functioning? What makes it only disruptive to cancer cells?",
  "Here are some more hints in that direction:\"It was found that PCNA in cancer cells is actually an isomer, allowing specific targeting.Furthermore the isomer doesnt seem to be the result of radom mutation but rather a mistranslation, which seems to be universal among many cancers making evolutionary resistance unlikely.\"",

  "I'm going to define a style of English writing called \"Death Metal English\". Here are some common traits of Death Metal English:Big, polysyllabic words: You dont have to use them correctly; you just have to use them. Bonus points for Greco-Latinate words that end in -ition, -ation, -ution, -ous, -ized, -ism, -ance, -ial, -ity, and variations thereon. Double bonus points for words ending semi-inappropriately in -ment, as in Torn Into Enthrallment. These words dont even have to be real. Is Wormeds Multivectorial Reionization a real thing? Who cares?Adjectives: In Death Metal English, theyre like guitar solos. You arent using enough. Add more.Prepositional phrases: Same is true here, too the more prepositional phrases, the better. -ation word of the ominous word is perhaps the most brutal of all grammatical constructions, which is why Procreation of the Wicked is one of the best song titles ever. It also has parentheses, which are a less common but still valued component of Death Metal English.Progressive tense: Especially useful for song titles. Verbing the noun is also a great default song title, as in Cloning the Stillborn, Infecting the Crypts, and Christening the Afterbirth.Passive voice: Active verbs arent brutal. Passive voice is useful when you need to add more syllables to a line to make it fit the riff. Plus, it highlights whatever weird power dynamic is going on in your lyrics. Why say The beast hath consumed him when you could say He hath been consumed by the beast? Speaking of which Archaic or pseudo-Biblical verbiage: If you write like you are some kind of ancient, ageless force who is unfamiliar with modern grammatical conventions, you are probably pretty evil. Bonus points for using constructions that evoke the King James Bible, which is ironically among the most metal texts in the English canon. Thou, hast, thine, and so forth are all great; unto is my personal favorite. Yoda-style unconventional sentences can achieve the same effect, as in Civilized I shall not be / By the holy strain of laws or I know the texts divine both from Morbid Angels Brainstorm. Dave Vincent and Glen Benton are probably responsible for popularizing these tricks in a death metal context, but Nile raised them to an art form. Speaking of which: award more bonus points for each reference to any obscure or fictional non-Christian deity.Grandiloquent metaphor: This is death metal. Make whatever youre talking about sound really big and important.Illogical or meaningless sentences: This one certainly isnt unique to Death Metal English, but its popular in the realm. Writing lyrics that make grammatical and substantive sense is not sufficiently off-putting and obscurantist for some bands, and doing so over crazy shred riffage is pretty hard to boot. Instead, why not say, as Impetuous Ritual did on Convoluting Unto Despondent Anachronism, something like this: Propagate correlated malediction / Reclamation of hierarchic genetic throne / Bound to iniquitous subordinancy / Coerced through conductive bedlam? The lyrics to Impetuous Rituals Relentless Execution of Ceremonial Excrescence are a treasure trove of Death Metal English without peer.And here are some examples of normal English translated into Death Metal English:Normal English: Commuting to workDeath Metal English: TRANSPORTATION OF THE WAGEBOUND UNTO THE NEXUS OF PERPETUAL QUOTIDIAN ENSLAVEMENTNormal English: This bok choy isnt very goodDeath Metal English: CASTIGATING THE VERDANT ISSUANCE OF THE SOILS OF JIANGNANNormal English: I need to take a napDeath Metal English: RIPPED INTO THE UTTER EXHAUSTION OF THE MIDDLE DAYNormal English: Thanks for explaining the train scheduleDeath Metal English: PROFFERING GRATITUDE UPON THE CHRONOCRATION OF THE JUGGERNAUTS OF RETICULATED METALS AND FIRENormal English: You have to mow the lawnDeath Metal English: BRING DOWN THE SCYTHE OF GODS UPON THE NECKS OF THE GREEN-RIBBED LEGIONS AND SWEEP AWAY THEIR WRETCHED BODIES; THOU ART IMPLORED BY MEPlease use these to convert anything I say into Death Metal English.",

  "```n the first episode of the television show The Resident, a nurse tells the young protagonist that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States after cancer and heart disease. They dont want us talking about that, she adds.This shocking and unforgettable line did not begin life with The Resident. Since 2016, it has earwormed its way into the public discourse. A recent email I received linked to this myth and asked me to have a look at it before blindly trusting the official narrative in medicine. The implication was that medicine kills and I should be more open-minded to the alternatives.Is medical error really the third leading cause of death in the United States? Investigating a claim like this invites accusations of insensitivity, so allow me to state a few important things. Medical errors are real. Some people have died or been permanently injured because of errors fostered by a healthcare system that needs to be improved. Errors in medicine include wrong diagnoses, drug dosage miscalculations, and treatment delays. These errors are likely to be underestimated because studies tend to focus exclusively on hospitals and not on the rest of the healthcare system; because some errors may only have debilitating effects years down the road for a patient and are thus harder to trace; and because reporting these errors may not be encouraged by the medical culture. The patient safety movement is important because errors that can be prevented should be prevented. I have personally been on the receiving end of a minor medical error, in which a clear laboratory report was misread by my doctor and, had my condition deteriorated, I presumably would not have been given antibiotics because my doctor thought the report said my infection was viral in nature. I have, in this small way, experienced part of this problem and am sensitive to it.But as has been written on the topic, there are no useful fictions in medicine. The idea that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. is indeed a fiction, an overestimation that has negative consequences.Turning apples into orangesThis whole story has its prelude in a 2000 report called To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System by the Institute of Medicine. The report took two studies, one done in Colorado and Utah and the other in New York, and extrapolated their results to all hospital admissions in the United States, concluding that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans must be dying each year as a result of medical errors. The lower estimate exceeded the eighth leading cause of death and trumped fatalities from motor vehicle accidents.In 2016, the British Medical Journal BMJ published an analysis by a research fellow, Michael Daniel, and a professor who had developed the operating room checklist, Martin A. Makary, both from the Department of Surgery at Johns Hopkins University. To call it a study would be inaccurate. It was a call for better reporting of medical errors, motivated by a lack of funding available to support quality and safety research and propped up by a back-of-the-envelope calculation. The authors looked at the few studies that had been published on the problem since the Institute of Medicine report. They took the mean death rate from medical error from those studies and extrapolated them to the total number of U.S. hospital admissions in 2013. After adding that this extrapolation was surely an underestimation of the actual problem, they concluded that this would mean medical error would rank third in the Centers for Disease Controls list of causes of death in the U.S. This became the title of their published analysis, which has been cited in at least 1,265 papers according to Scopus, and this memorable idea spread to news articles, television shows, and alternative medicine circles.Critics of this analysis have pointed out many flaws. It is based on studies whose data was never meant to be generalized to the entire U.S. hospitalized population. For example, one of these studies, by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was conducted in beneficiaries of Medicare, who are aged 65 or older, have disabilities or have end-stage renal disease which requires dialysis or transplant. The study authors counted the number of deaths in their sample to which they believed medical errors had contributed, and this number was then used in the BMJ analysis to extrapolate to all U.S. hospitalizations. However, this makes the mistake of extrapolating an observation found in one sample to a different type of population. Case in point: if we look at everyone hospitalized in the United States, one patient out of ten is there to deliver a baby. Taking death statistics from a sample of Medicare patients and extrapolating it to all hospitalized patients is like turning apples into oranges, to adapt a popular saying to the current situation.Moreover, the studies whose results were averaged for the BMJ analysis were never about uncovering preventable deaths; rather, their objective was to round up numbers on harm from medical care. Harm can lead to death, but this causal link needs to be properly evaluated, and it wasnt in those studies. Dr. Kaveh G. Shojania and Pr. Mary Dixon-Woods, who wrote a sharp commentary of the BMJ back-of-the-envelope calculation, give an example of how easy it can be to mistakenly draw the causation arrow from medical error to death. Imagine a patient who enters the intensive care unit with multi-system organ failure due to their bodys extreme response to an infection. Doctors mistakenly give the patient an antibiotic to which they have had an allergic reaction in the past, and the patient develops a rash from the antibiotic. The antibiotic is changed, but a week later, the patient dies as their organs stop working. Yes, the authors argue, a medical error was committed, but it probably did not cause the patients death. Using studies that identify medical errors that were followed by death to declare that these medical errors necessarily caused these deaths is not fair. What these studies do not take into account is how long these patients would have lived had they received optimal medical care. Since it is not considered, it can skew the impact of medical errors.Another problem arises when we look at how many deaths were reported in the studies combined into the BMJ analysis. The Office of the Inspector General study mentioned above reported 12 deaths associated with medical errors. Two more studies used in the analysis listed nine and 14 deaths. The remaining one claimed nearly 400,000 deaths. Generalizing from so few deaths with the exception of this last study to all U.S. hospitalizations, as Shojania and Dixon-Woods put it, surely warrants substantial skepticism.What we end up with, when we look beyond the scary headline of medical errors as the third leading cause of death, is an analysis of studies that were never meant to look at deaths caused by medical errors, often reporting a very small number of deaths from populations that are not generalizable to the whole of the United States, and being combined in a crude way. The BMJs higher estimate of preventable deaths due to medical error440,000 patients a yeartranslates to 62% of all hospital deaths, as was pointed out by Drs. Benjamin L. Mazer and Chadi Nabhan. That nearly two thirds of all deaths occurring in hospitals would be due to medical error strains credulity. Indeed, more recent studies have looked at the phenomenon and the numbers that have emerged are a far cry from 62%. A study from the UK reports that 3.6% of hospital deaths were due to preventable medical error; a similar study out of Norway reports 4.2%; and a meta-analysis of the problem published in the BMJ in 2019 concludes that at least one in 20 patients are affected by preventable patient harm, with 12% of this group suffering from permanent disability or dying because of this harm.The authors of this recent meta-analysis are quick to point out that the numbers reported by the studies they looked at vary considerably. It is not easy to determine if a particular case of patient harm was preventable or not. In fact, a study that specifically tested for this reported that the doctors who look at medical files to make this assessment often disagree. In their study, if one reviewer decided that a death in hospital was definitely or probably preventable, there was only a 16% chance that a second reviewer would agree with them, and there was a nearly identical chance that a second reviewer would clearly disagree. This problem of medical errors is like an iceberg. Everyone can agree on its visible tip, but when we try to assess the much larger size of the phenomenon by squinting through the waters, disagreements abound. The third leading cause of death then becomes a useful shorthand, an urgent rallying cry we are not supposed to question because the preventable harm is real and desperately needs to be addressed. But relying on this crude overestimation is not harmless.Jumbo jets and magic carpetsThe consequences of exaggerating the scope of this very real problem should not be dismissed. In 2019, a video released by the National Rifle Association used this myth to claim that medical malpractice was deadlier than guns, specifically that deaths from medical errors were 500 times higher than deaths from accidental gun incidents. Sure, its a simple bit of whataboutism, but it provides ammunition to irresponsible gun owners, allowing them to casually deflect criticism. More worryingly, the claim has been weaponized by believers in alternative medicine to paint conventional medicine as dangerouspractically the equivalent of playing Russian roulettewhile touting the alleged safety of their favourite pseudomedical practices. Indeed, if you constantly read that more Americans are killed in U.S. hospitals every six months than died in the entire Vietnam War, that medical errors kill the equivalent of three fully loaded jumbo jets crashing every other day, and that these errors and injuries are epidemics borne of a cult of denial and complacency, as popular medical papers and reports tell us, you may wonder if homeopathy would be a more reasonable alternative.Not only are these scary comparisons derived from dodgy numbers, as demonstrated earlier, but to compare the harms of medicine to the harms of alternative medicine without looking at their respective benefits isnt fair. The health benefits of acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractic and herbalism are few and far in between. For an in-depth review of the evidence, I would strongly recommend Simon Singh and Edzard Ernsts book, Trick or Treatment? Alternative medicine on trial. Meanwhile, medicine is about balancing risks and benefits. Its an imperfect system, one that requires active campaigning for improvements, but as the saying goes, problems in aircraft design should not encourage us to see if carpets can fly.It has been said, with regards to medical errors, that you cant manage what you cant measure.

  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . a little there on top of it, that will not be future-proof. We've seen this a bunch of times with companies who build on top of us to get a nice business, but then we produce the next model, and it doesn't sustain. And so I think the thing that is actually very hard for us to just go disrupt tomorrow is domain-specific work that's actually very hard. If you're selling to hospitals, there's a lot of work to sell to hospitals. You need to really understand users, you need to understand the impact on patients, you need to be able to work with regulators, like that's something that we can't do by just building better technology. And so I think that really figuring out what is going to just be gone tomorrow versus what is durable, I think that's where the value lies. I have a more of a question. So since you've been playing around with large models, and people talk about emerging properties, and I wanted to know whether you have a good intuition of whether, like, including certain kinds of data sets will unlock in the future. For instance, people talk about including code into the training data to unlock complex reasoning capabilities, but is that the actual case that you're seeing? Also, you've been playing around with GPT-4 where it has the visual domain, visual modality as well. Does that actually unlock additional features? Well, I think so. That's what I was going to say. Yeah, I can probably give you some insight into that. So yeah, very much so, you know, reasoning-heavy data sets, they increase the reasoning capabilities of the models. I think what we do is we have a very comprehensive set of profiles that we're looking at. So those of you who have all of the profiles, reasoning is not how much it helps as an assistant. And I'll tell you, we use smart data set collection to try to get any of those people. Definitely reasoning is one of the top things that we keep in mind. I think it will be one of the big qualitative improvements going forward, just seeing which of the big qualitative improvements going forward. from a content center to the script. And the current model gets some authentic state. So do you have some strategy? That's a good question. It works, definitely, yeah. So I think the personations improve with every model. Every model will resolve the best personations. I think there are statements that people do. One very common technique is to do a little augmented discrimination. And it goes into observations. Sometimes what people have done, which is interesting, is to get first, judge a key to generate an answer. And then have another person who will go through the answer and identify it and find references for it as to where things are going. But we have seen customers who have really solved hallucinations for their domain, including the very difficult ones like legal. So it is possible. And it's just, you gotta do the work. Yeah, I think, as a generation, we can implement hallucinations. And yeah, I think, seeing some of our visibility, there's one where we've seen that house can identify when they're starting a system. This is our recent math template. And we're making progress there. Okay. I pay a fortune to be a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. I'm a lawyer. This is our recent math paper, and we're making progress. Good. I'm from NLP, and I have a question. It seems in some domains there are greater challenges in terms of precisely, and consistently controlling LLM. And in relation to this, Microsoft has recently released an open source framework called Guidance to address this issue. And does OpenAI have any preparation or initiatives related to this controlling guidelines? Yeah, so on the client side, Guidance, things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of things like that, we think they're great. And then on the server side, first of all, we'll have a new model coming into the API soon that should do JSON output and other structured outputs much more reliably. We're looking at things like, on the server side, being able to give us a grammar. There's open source implementations of a lot of these things, but you give us a grammar and the output will conform to it. So we're really looking into by sort of implementing these things here, the biggest bang for the buck. But generally the way we think about it is, we want to build the highest quality model, so you ask for what you want, you get what you want. That's it. And whenever that falls short, we'll be very involved. That's not the one I'm producing. Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . . .Do you have a person negative for tonight? Please. No, no, no, no. This has been by far like, I've done maybe 15 of these, I'm going to ask for some negatives for tonight. This has been by far, like I've done maybe 15 of these, this is the nicest one. So as a developer, my first venture company was with the iOS app store in 2008. We built on that with a lot of positive hope, but over the years, different things kind of got into place that made it more restrictive. We've pivoted, we're going all in with AI and education, and we're building a language learning app. The problem right now is there's some extra rhythm that we need to increase, but when you look at the process, it's so vague, it doesn't look like there's transparency. And so my concern, especially with my background with previous platforms, is what if we're needing a rate increase, it's not just because it's optional, but you've got usage, you've built this product, and there's no transparency. You can't, it's just something where right now, it seems like it's case by case approval. And so to me, that's like a very kind of vague and scary place to be as a developer. So I just want to say, I think this summit has not really been working very well. And I think people in the Bay Area have found a way of getting to us when this is needed. We need to get a lot better. So I just want to give you all my contact details so you can let me know. But I think in the future we'll definitely have a better answer to this. We will be more planned because I'm sure you're trying to anticipate growth and you're threatening to anticipate growth, and you're like, even if we have 100x customers, how am I going to be able to pay for it, to control for this, and how am I going to access it? The second issue is, I noticed some people, some communities are getting early access to certain things, but compared to the iOS app store, it's like, it didn't really matter if our competitors got a little bit early access to the next iOS version, because it wasn't revolutionary, each change. But with AI, every three months, things are changing so fast. It's like, how can people, companies, have a fair chance when some companies are getting earlier access? We all grew up on the iOS app store model, and we thought it didn't matter that much. We now realize how much it screwed things up, and how much it screwed things up and how much it can be a good effect. That's totally unconventional. We want to do the same thing in the future. It was truly just we had to go through that learning process. We didn't expect it to have such an impact. But we want to be a platform people can depend on. We realize that means people need reliability, dependability, predictability, but also good treatment. So we're going to work on those. One thing I would say is we're just like, it's quite tight for us right now with the supply of GPUs. And as we get more of that, we'll be able to learn things like normal operations and more frequency. Yeah, that point actually is really my answer to the question. So, it's great to be here. I'm Don. I'm a co-founder and CEO of Bend AI. We are making generative AI engines. So serving generative AI in models like Jetty Q requires a large number of GPUs, resulting in high cost and a negative environment demand. So one approach to addressing this challenge is to develop different serving software that uses a number of GPUs significantly. So, please speak on the software initiatives or approaches pursued by OpenAI in this area. I can take it, but is anyone else more interested in the inference stuff? So yes, we do a lot of inference work. And it really started even with GPT-3. We built this model. And I actually did the initial productionization of it. And so you have this research model that takes all these GPUs. We compressed it down to basically end up running on one machine. So that was effectively a 10 to 20x reduction in footprint. And then over time, we've just been improving inference technology on a lot of angles. And so we do a lot of quantization, we do a lot of, honestly, there's a lot of just like systems work because you have all these requests coming in, you need to batch them together efficiently. The GPU has lots of different resources, right? It has memory bandwidth, it has compute, it has the actual sort of DRAM storage. And for each one of these, you can actually convert it into additional performance if you can also overwrite your communication to the computer.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks: . .So there's a lot of that kind of work that we do that's quite sophisticated in-house. And we've been actually, it's been really encouraging to see the whole ecosystem, right? There's like so much work that's happening right now across the whole open source world. You look at like the efficiency gains that have been happening with Lama, like those are the kinds of things that we really love to see. So I think it's just something that's very much on our mind, it's so clear this stuff is the lifeblood and is actually the limit on our ability to scale, and so every law police comes out as something that can benefit everyone here. I could add a word to that, maybe an obvious point, but maybe reassuring is that all of our incentives are very aligned when it comes to tennis optimization, just because we want to serve more people. When we were able to come up with the tennis price decrease, that was just as much of a happy moment for all of us as it was for our users. We're working on it, and yeah, we're pretty sure about it. Can we actually hear from some women developers and founders here? Why is it only a man here? Thank you, thank you for giving me this chance. I am Cho Kwon-Som, and I work at Information Securities, which is a big security company in South Korea. So, for companies like YNAS, our customers are very sensitive about the accurate decision because it's quickly related to how their assets could change. So I was wondering if there would be a way to measure the certainness of the response of the JPT, the chat JPT response, well, would there be a kind of percentage or some kind of a more way to explain how they are open about the response? I'm not taking questions. You want to? You want to? Yeah. Yeah, so we are looking at this. It's interesting, yeah. JPT is working with a lot of corporate presidents Yeah, so we are looking at this. So they are concerning the information protection and the security of us. And I wonder whether the open AI will target those corporate partners so they can have their own dedicated large model. And so they want those large models to be trained. And the inference running in their inside, in-house infrastructure, how would you kind of pursue those customers? So I think client training, being able to customize it to your own company data is one of the most impactful things. I think it's where companies will get a lot of power from. In terms of inferencing on their own data centers, it's something we haven't pursued yet. And what we do, our libraries have a fine-tuning endpoint, and we have a very big data policy where any data that you upload, it's your data. No other person gets to access it. If you're fine-tuning a model, you have a customized model. That model can only be accessed by yourselves, not anyone else. So there's a lot of things that we do, and we serve through Microsoft Azure, so Microsoft Azure allows us to have productions there as well. So we have quite a few, very large companies in the United States that are using this technology, and one of its enemies are large banks in the US that are comfortable sharing the graduate data with us. I'm actually curious, do you think that Azure is enough for companies like that, or do you need your own in-house infrastructure? Sometimes it's government policy, or sometimes they're internal policy. They cannot upload their data to any kind of cloud or or data center of the other company. So they ask the cloud companies to install the machines inside or in certain physical locations. That makes sense. I also have a lot of questions. Can I ask one question? So one question I really have is that since Greg you mentioned, OpenAI is still a small company. It's not too old. And you're using a lot of the techniques that were already available before. So then why don't these startups use your service rather than spend let's say the next two years spending a lot of money, and because we know, because you have shown that it's possible to train their own language models, while they use your service. Still, OpenAI is small, as you said, it's been only five years, or in fact, if you count from the GPT three days, it's like four years or three years at most. So wouldn't, let's say, any of the startups here, three years of, sorry, wouldn't any of these startups be able to train the same quality, let's say, language model within actually less than three years ago, three years ago. Would any of these startups be able to train the same quality as a language model within actually less than three years because we know that you have done it, right? So why did they lose years of this? So should they try? Yes? Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C .- STT , .Sam's gonna answer this question before you answer it. I've got my own spin on it. Well, I've got my own spin on it, which is, look, first of all, I think as a startup, you get to be best in the world at one thing, at most one thing. And if you want that one thing to be advancing AI, you can. You can choose to pursue it, but you're not going to be able to pursue anything else. So that's a first decision. So that's a real opportunity cost. That, for us, that's the thing we want to do. And we actually sort of choose not to do so many things that would be pretty extremely exciting. All the things I was saying, like going into any one domain, you just kind of can't do that if you're going to do the kind of thing that we do. And there's a lot of actual forward planning that's involved, to actually build the supercomputers. That's not something that you just put together a supercomputer in six months. There's no GPUs out there, in part because we have... I need that! But it's like, that's one input, right? If you don't have the GPUs, you're not going to do it. Unless, again, maybe there's a magical breakthrough to be made, but that's a starting point. And then, one thing that's easy to miss is the degree to which every single part of the system multiplies. You can start to see this with some of the open source models. A 40 billion parameter model, they're not all made equal. There are so many people who have tried to train a GPT-3 quality model and not gotten there. In fact, internally, after we trained GPT-3, we had a whole year of failed attempts to exceed it. And we had to rebuild the entire training stack, every single detail, we had to sort of, you know, go over with a fine-toothed comb, and you just keep seeing all these little problems. And so much of it, by the way, it's boring work. Like, it actually really sucks. I love that kind of work, like that is what interests me. Like, when I don't have to, like, clone something brilliant and new, like, you know, the brilliant new stuff that happens over here, for me, it's the boring engineering work. And then you need to coordinate a lot of people. There's a lot of expertise you need to develop. For us, one of the biggest successful programs has been the residency, where we take people that don't know anything about AI, and we train them. We spend a lot of time teaching them AI. But you also need to have that AI expertise already. So it's like, there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's like there's these flywheels that we've been putting into effect for the whole time that we've existed. So it's not impossible. We've shown it is possible. We're going to keep trying it. Hopefully we will continue to be the leading edge and be able to host these services and accelerate the work that you do. If you want to do it too, again, I think you're welcome to. But we'd love it if you just came and worked with us, because I think that this is just a hard thing, it's a hard engineering problem, and there's so many benefits from it. Can we also hear the answer from the non, let's say, president, non-CEO? Yeah, go ahead. Please. Please. Please. It's way too hard. I'd like to add more detailed questions on enterprise and fine tuning. There was a question, so you already asked people, so can we... Did you get the... We do want to talk about that. So we're... we do power messaging and other applications, and we have a lot of customers who are trying to plug in OpenAI into our system, to power chat. And we see... so how serious is OpenAI about BPA business? Because we see you guys releasing customer features first, and it takes quite a while before it becomes available for you guys.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , For example, like plugins. We'd love to use a plugin as quickly as possible to wait for those releases for your clients. We talk about this a lot, actually. Do you have a friend? We end up in a lot of these conversations. We get it. And I think that for us, you can see through the past six, 12 months, our own indecision on exactly what to focus on. And to that focus point, it's hard to, what we want to do is we want to advance these models. That is, I think, the core for us. We want to make them better, and we want to get them out there. And then exactly what the mechanism is, is it through chatGBT, which took off much more than I was expecting, is it through API so lots of people can build on top of it, what's the best way to do it? I think it actually varies a lot per feature. And so the interesting thing about plugins, as an example, is they don't work yet. It's still, it's like, you know, there's some of our features, like for example, Code Interpreter, I think that's starting to really work, but like, man, that was like months of slog, right? And that was like just a lot of time not working. Third-party plugins still don't really work. I mean, how many people have tried third-party plugins in CacheBT? You know, was anyone like, this is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give is the most important thing? Like, we'll get there, right? So this is kind of the story, is that the choices we tend to make are the ones that give us the most engineering philosophy. So we are very committed to start this building on top of us. We want to be a platform, there's no question about that for us. You will sometimes see us have things develop and bake in the consumer side much faster, or because it's much faster for us to do it, and then we bring it to the platform. Sometimes we'll do things on the platform first. GPT-V, so the vision side, is a good example, where we've been working with partners there. It's not in Chagin-PF yet. It will be, right? So I think that you can see this kind of nuance. And for us, it's always calibrated by what gives us the most velocity and helps us get to that future model fastest. Just to kind of talk you through what our constraints are, I think that we know that to developers reliability is key, right? So we might want to try a bunch of different new research directions, and for us, consumer app, which I think is the fastest way of doing this, because it's a free product, We don't want to change our models on our API business customers, and we want to keep the API structure as well. And because we all kind of empathize with developers, we're definitely much more careful about that. At the same time, we empathize with the fact that our API developers would want the latest and the greatest as well. And part of that was just kind of the partisan decision behind our announcement of the emerging models, but our large model, we haven't actually published the models since then yet, but that's the reason behind why we did that. As an example, we'll have a function call coming very soon, where basically this is exactly the mechanism that we build plugins through. That will be in the API in two weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing the model soon. few weeks, something like that for now. We'll be releasing a new model soon. And all of that was because we made so many mistakes and learned so much from the deployment within chat GPT. Actually, okay, let's hear from another woman developer. Let's do that again. I'm actually not a developer, but I'm here. Oh, okay, sorry about sorry. No, no worries. I'm Yan from Speak. It's been great working with you all. Great to hear. Well, thank you. I just joined a month ago, but yeah. So my question is around, given how fast things are changing at the moment, would you say that there's a version of a world where we don't even need to learn a foreign language? And how should we as a company work on that? I think I can think of a solid one. I think that the world is super close to translation not being a necessary thing. That said, I think, you know, like the 80-20, I think a lot of people just have very easy access to understanding the gist of things, but when it comes to the really detailed idioms or concepts like , , stuff like that, I don't still know how to translate that into English. Concepts like one When you like don't know you're talking to a when you don't know, you're talking to a friend, you don't know something, you're like, oh, is this a thing? You don't just, everyone stop, hold your phone and check. Even though you could, all the facts are there, right? There's this robot in the sky that knows way more than any human does. And maybe we'll get there with language. I think this last mile problem that Joanne was saying, I think that's real. I think that this is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe is a place, again, back to where's the opportunity for startups, right? I think that maybe startups can bridge that, maybe you can build systems or even just sort of techniques that help people get there. And I think this like moving the machine closer to the humans, but that last mile problem, that's still going to be there. I think another last mile problem that we're thinking a lot about internally is also there's kind of this unequal representation of training data among different languages. So for example, it's very easy to find training data for Chinese or Korean where you find major spoken languages. But there are hundreds of other less spoken and kind of deflected languages that are often forgotten. But also, that's also something that we're trying to deal with. And I think that will be hard to go to find a good translation for those images in the future. One more time about language, I actually have a question for the group, which is how's our Korean performance? How does it compare to English? Slow. Slow. Slow. So I've got a question related to the flu message. The flu is really great.Please write in Korean language.",
  "continue writingPlease write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think it's much, than the degree that you can buy and the reasoning skill, etc But I don't think you understand how much is slow in Korea I cannot really understand Korea Because how much information we want to generate in Korea is painstaking and especially when we try to build a product on top of that even prototyping is quite impossible because you have to test it in real world situation but if it's slow, you cannot even test it I think, you talked about getting down the price and speeding up the model. I think speeding up the model is more important because at least you can protect it. I think you can pay for it. We've heard that a lot in the field. So, my question is, do you think in the future there would be a length barrier? Because Korea's the speed model little or the vast amount of Korean and such like that? And second of all, I know you have a plan to improve that, but what kind of scale do you want to look at? Like 10x, 5x, something like that? Or what kind of general schedule for improving the speed of the university in other languages? This is again a conversation that we have. Yeah, Greg and I talk about this a lot. Yeah, so I think given, like since we've trained chapter PTN, since we've had a ton of evolution, we are now seeing how many instances a lot of our users are not talking to us in English. I think that was a huge update for us. We thought that it would be maybe 80% English and 20% non-English. I don't think I can show you the actual numbers, but it is way off from that. So we've learned a lot, and we are taking that into account as we plan for next generation roles and post-renewing our research as well. Korean, I don't really know how to talk about this, but it should be way better. So. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I think probably, so someone had mentioned earlier, tokenization, like I think that's one place that we can improve things. I think there's the, you know, we just, the amount, like we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can the amount, we have to put together these training mixes of different amounts of different languages. There I think we can increase quite a bit, and I'm planning on doing so. And then there's just simply more GPUs, you know, more, all the inference optimization that we need. So I would definitely expect, in general, we are on very much the Moore's Law style curve, where it's like all the existing things just get better faster, but much faster than Moore's Law. We did the 10x price reduction for faster and better quality for 3.5. I think we can do the same thing for 4. These things, it won't happen tomorrow, but certainly 6-12 months from now, if we're not like GP4 feels like 3.5 does today, we've done something wrong. Yeah, we'll get you a 10x speedup. I think there's also more options with customizing models. As soon as we release that functionality, it will be quite easy to swap the initial encoder. So when you're interested in a little bit of fine tuning, then we can work with K-alphabet. K-alababet is very good. It's a simple mapping, so it should be a pretty nice way to get to the phone as well as in English in terms of speed of this. I just, I'm sure somebody will do that very soon, as soon as we enable fine tuning. One more thing is that the more Korean users use our product, they give us feedback. So, if you want to give us feedback. And if you want to, if any of you want to give us data sets somehow or if you know how we can get a lot of high quality Korean language data, we'll take it from that. So, what's the benefit there? You get a better model of Korean? What's the general solution? We're happy to hear something. We have a lot of open data. I'm Joseph from Simply. It's a 1C company. The challenges that we're having are about data compliance issues. So, as I already said, to penetrate into enterprise customers, we have low credibility, right? So we got to get a soft 2G DPR, but that's fantastic. In terms of data privacy, some companies even banned using any product built on the 2G D3 or the 3G. So it really hinders our market penetration. So I'd just love to figuring a plan to address that. We're going to, yeah, we at OU also like marketing our cover on that. We don't train on any API data, but we have not made that well known enough. Our hope is that we get that message out more, and people will be more comfortable with it. So we're going to work on that. That's also something that's come up a lot in this training. So moving on, let me just add one thing. So you don't use that for training, but then you still save it as something. And that actually creates the situation where whatever you type in on the chatgpk API and whatnot is a public information load. So there's IP issues that are related. And then, for instance, pharmaceuticals and whatnot, they all ban those using the chatgpk API because of Christiaan's statement. So in chatgpk, you can turn it off and you can say, don't and whatnot, they all ban the use of the chatGPT at the moment because of the pre-settings. So in chatGPT, you can turn it off and you can say don't store your money by data, don't train on it, but by default we are trying to completely replace all the usage of chatGPT, so we do. Data retention on the APL, we do retain for 30 days, but only for trust and safety, not like compliance, we're not looking at that. that are not compliance or not up to the standard.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I wanted to ask questions regarding the way to building services. So what we are now questioning is like how to use GPT models to make customers relate to the question and answer in robots. And we are now doing like how the other developers do. We put our user queries to search engines and get the right context and put the context that you prefer and send it to GP and actually it doesn't work. I don't know why but it doesn't work. There is a negative feedback. But I somehow feel like GP cannot find what would be the most important context in this context. So for example, if user asks us to put information about banking products, and then the most important information would be interest rates. But the answer is sometimes contain that interest rate, but sometimes it does not contain that rate. So I want to ask if there is any intuition for it to make all the things that are right or not. But if we put a lot of instructions in there, then we are suffering from the number of interpreters. So yeah, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is the number of alternatives. So, Josh, do you have a question? This is an extremely Boris question. Boris is simply the expert on this. There's a lot of things you can do there. The open source and open-active book, which is a great resource. I believe there's maybe one or two examples for how you can do this. Just very quickly, you can first have a model generate the answer, which may be how to state it, and then you use that answer to do the lookup. That's one thing that can help. You have a lot of things like specific product names, then adding like DP25 or any other, that's a TF-IDF or anything that also is based on keywords, in addition to the embedding similarity, will help massively. I think those are probably the two main things I would say. Also, reducing the size of the context that you are treating, I'm saying like maybe 100 or 200 tokens in English, maybe 600 in Korean, seems to work better for these types of use cases. And are you currently using GPT-4? I'll be ready to announce when you think that we should. Okay, definitely, definitely. Okay, got it, got it. Oh, and I have one more question. So, yes, GPT-4 is much better. If you have a lot of very short contexts, even though to a human it sort of doesn't seem that organized, GPT-4 is really good at knowing which information to use and which information to take out. So it doesn't get as confused by formats as GPT-5 does, when you're taking out multiple, very varying types of information. Okay, I will answer that. I will say more. So when it comes to data supply, I want to know if the model would be able to answer questions like, so our customers want AI to answer anything that they want. So I borrow money, like this amount of money from the bank, and I want to get loan free with repayment plans, something like that. So for a GP, 3.5 and more, it doesn't really work when it comes to the repayment plans. So your plan would be like kind of fuzzy. I think you mean before with fine-tuning, which is a little bit slower. Oh, okay, with fine tuning. With really high quality data, which I'm sure that's... ...for the new IDMLs. Go for it. Oh, yeah, so we're constantly trying to improve GPT-4 and 3.0 as well. And we have an open source, again, repository called OpenAI-DMLs. So if you just send us the cases that the model has fallen, the model is a problem, and we can actually incorporate that into our repo to kind of test and just go by your signals on whether or not it's good. So that's another way of trying to answer that. I'd love to read it. I really want to reinforce what Joanne said there, because e-mails is the best way to steer our roadmap. If you send us, again, we want the negative feedback, if you send us cases where we suck, where we fail, we have an internship, we will make it better. I have one more negative. Oh, please. So actually, we are running something called Esco. We got more than one million people coming and chatting. And then we just sent data to OpenAI and to SOS. The really nice thing about to lay out the open AI and the precise. So the really nice thing about open AI is that they can understand the context very well. The really sad or bad thing is that we have to send all the previous text. That means that easily you can fill up all the tokens. So I think that there are much better ways to do that, to understand the whole context, otherwise working on it. We paid a lot in the past. I think that there are much better ways to understand all the content, otherwise you're working on it. We paid a lot in the beginning. Yeah, thanks for that. Do you have any ideas? Yeah, well, we'll have from a, I mean, we've talked about, so there's two angles here. One is a pricing angle, right, which is like, why do I have to pay this n squared price? And that's something, again, I guess you're right that I actually spent a lot of time on this one too. I mean, we now have 50% off the inventory. Let's not say that that's good enough, but that's like we understand. And, yeah, I guess I think that the, I basically would say the economy is going to keep expanding, and so but I expect actually like where we're going to go, I think the API will evolve. One of the things that I'm really excited about is moving to much more of a kind of you send me messages, you get back messages, so it feels a little bit more chatgy. It's much more stilted. I hold prompt, I send you the prompt, I get back the response. I send you a new prompt, I get back the response. Especially with images, you do not want to be shuttled and go back and forth. I think there will be a technical shift. I think actually this will unlock a lot more creativity. A lot of what we think about is, how do you get, for example, things like plugins. You want to make that really easy for people to use in the API and not have to rebuild all the same sort of serving infrastructure that we have. So we should be able to run those on the server side.Please write in Korean language.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , I think that there's a lot of interesting opportunities from our perspective to help solve some of these problems and just open up more opportunity. So as we are around 100 years old, it's getting stronger and faster. So I think the startup companies may have some more challenges to differentiate themselves as a company who is still doing the same thing that we are doing. So as a well-known startup investor, what's your image? How do companies help you differentiate themselves? and we have some of you guys that want, what's your image, you are some companies that help you differentiate things like this? I think technology alone is very, very big differentiator. Open my eyes, I'll give some example of how they're coming, but there are companies with an actual technical model. And even then you can argue about how much we really have and what's happening with that source. We are only as good as our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation. And I think that's true for companies too. You can't, you can't imagine a commodity that's hard and it's not usually how it works. So the fact that there's a cool new platform does not excuse you from the hard work of building a business. You still gotta focus on customers, build up modes, build up differentiation, figure out some sort of network effect. All of the standard things that it takes to differentiate a business still apply. Access to a technology is almost never a barrier. So I would like to go from Sahara, to a couple of these big companies who are pretty happy with it. You've got all the old networks. How do you imagine the ad revenue? Our expect, the thing that is most special about OpenAI is our ability to reliably go and figure out the next innovation each year. So everybody's chasing us right now on the LLMs. We are off and running off the next day. And that is the most interesting end, because otherwise you're just in this sort of like, darkness. So what is next for you? Are you going to teach third language? We'll tell you when it's ready. How did you foster the culture of repeatedly creating and waiting? Pain and suffering, honestly. But I think you just keep leading into the problems. At first, it was very scary, because you feel like a movie studio, because you realize that every time you're getting your big hit, now you're starting from scratch. And I think that over time, we've built up a lot of meta infrastructure and a lot of technology. You have all these processes that you've run before, you've seen where they fail. A lot of it is even getting people who come from the ML background to work well with people who come from the software background.",
  "Role: Professional IT TranslatorTasks:- - A,B,C - STT , By default, those people just think about problems differently. They're just going to not respect each other. We solved 10 versions of that problem at increasing level sophistication and so I think it's just like there's no one answer for these things it's just you just keep doing like a thousand little things like I think semiconductors is maybe a good analogy for a building process or something where it's just like there's all these components they all fit together you need to like solve hard problems at every layer of the stack and you just got to keep keep leaning into. I think that's actually quite useful advice for starters, so if anybody else wants to add on to this, I think it'd be great. Oh, yeah, I think it's one of the big differentiators between OpenAI and the other companies developing all of this is, it's really cultural. Like, everyone, you feel like, really wants to build their own future. It's not like people are selfish, they're there to kind of publish what they're doing, you know, kind of gain their own personality. We're all here, we know our role to play, and we really want to push for this to be good. And I think that really creates an environment where all the teams are working together and they see what comes. We really are a team. I've got a question about... Really quickly, we have five minutes, and right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session, so quick time check, we're going to cut it right at 50 we have to have people enter to the next session so quick time check we're gonna cut it exactly at 50 So let's say a company have a corporate trade data, like a size of several billion, several hundred billion to a trillion to a billion level. It's not trained on level where fine tuning a level. So there's two choices. A company can use a small amount of fine tuning, or they can train like 10 billion to 20 billion product models on their own. So, what do you think about those two solutions? I do think right now we don't have a good answer for how to leverage that scale of data through our platform. So I think that you can use subsets of that data, you can do retrieval, you can do those kinds of things, but to really find and bake it in, that's where we're not there yet. I would love to though, I would really love to, because we've actually built really amazing training technology. And again, it's just like, there's so many little pieces of the stack you have to get right, and just lead performance on the table otherwise. And so I think we should be able to be in a world where our fine-tuning API, as long as the compute is there, right, which that's the real thing that's hard with all this other software stuff, at least it's doable, but you don't have the silicon, you don't have the silicon. As long as we can get compute lined up behind it, then I think it would be really incredible. We'd actually really love to have companies that go and fine tune a GP4 on that scale of data, because I think you would just do really incredible things in all these domains. All right, are there any questions? There's only a few minutes left. Maybe we can all stand up, split up, then we can address the last set of questions. Sure, sounds good. I'm not sure how that's going to work. You have to share. People, just find people you want to ask a question.Please write in Korean language.",

For path finding, it's trickier, but there's probably a way to favor \"wide\" paths.

Reply in emojis\" ], model=\"gpt-4\", temperature=0,# Now interacting with itasync for output in emoji_chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> async for output in emoji_chain\"What is answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> 42```In this simple example, we are creating a [GPT4 Chain]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatChain that takes the user message and appends `\". Reply in emojis\"` to it for building the prompt, following the [OpenAI chat structure]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatMessage and with [zero temperature]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/llms/zero_temperature.Then, as you can see, we have an async loop going over each token output from `emoji_chain`. In LiteChain, everything is an async stream using Python's `AsyncGenerator` class, and the most powerful part of it, is that you can connect those streams by composing two Chains together:```python# Creating another Chain to translate back from emojitranslator_chain = OpenAIChatChain[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta] \"TranslatorChain\", lambda emoji_tokens: [ OpenAIChatMessage role=\"user\", content=f\"Translate this emoji message {[token.content for token in emoji_tokens]} to plain english\" ], model=\"gpt-4\",# Connecting the two Chains togetherchain = emoji_chain.and_thentranslator_chain# Trying out the whole flowasync for output in chain\"Hey there, how is it going?\": printoutput.data.content, end=\"\"#=> \"Hello, have a nice day working on your computer!\"```As you can see, it's easy enough to connect two Chains together using the `and_then` function. There are other functions available for composition such as `map`, `collect`, `join` and `gather`, they form the small set of abstractions you need to learn to build complex Chain compositions for your application, and they behave as you would expect if you have Function Programming knowledge. You can read all about it in the [reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html. Once you learn those functions, any Chain will follow the same patterns, enabling you to build complex LLM applications.As you may also have noticed, Chains accept type signatures, EmojiChain has the type `[str, OpenAIChatDelta]`, while TranslatorChain has the type `[Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta], OpenAIChatDelta]`, those mean respectively the *input* and *output* types of each Chain. Since the EmojiChain is taking user output, it simply takes a `str` as input, and since it's using OpenAI Chat API with GPT-4, it produces `OpenAIChatDelta`, which is [the tokens that GPT-4 produces one at a time]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/contrib/index.html#litechain.contrib.OpenAIChatDelta. TranslatorChain then takes `Iterable[OpenAIChatDelta]` as input, since it's connected with the output from EmojiChain, it takes the full list of the generated tokens to later extract their content and form its own prompt.The type signatures are an important part of LiteChain, having them can save a lot of time preventing bugs and debugging issues caused for example when Chain B is not expecting the output of Chain A. Using an editor like VSCode with PyLance allows you to get warned that Chain A doesn't fit into Chain B before you even try to run the code, you can read about LiteChain typing [here]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/type_signatures.Last but not least, you may also have noticed that both the emojis and the translation got printed in the final output, this is by design. In LiteChain, you always have access to everything that has gone through the whole chain in the final stream, this means that debugging it is very trivial, and a [`debug`]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.debug function is available to make it even easier. A property `output.final : bool` [is available]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html#litechain.ChainOutput.final to be checked if you want to print just the results of the final Chain, but there are also more utility functions available to help you work with output stream as you wish, check out more about it on our [Why Streams? guide]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/docs/chain-basics/why_streams and [the reference]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain/reference/litechain/index.html.# Prompts on the outsideIn our experience, when working with LLM applications, the main part you must spend tunning are your prompts, which are not always portable if you switch LLMs. The content one chain produces might change a lot how another chain should be written, the prompt carry the personality and the goal of your app, doing good prompt engineering can really make it or break it.That's why LiteChain does not hide prompts away in agents, we will give examples in the documentation, but believe you should build your own agents, to be able to customize them and their prompts later. LiteChain simply wants to facilitate and standardize the piping and connection between different parts, so you can focus on what is really important, we don't want you to spend time with LiteChain itself.# Bring your own integrationIn addition, as the name implies, LiteChain wants to stay light, not embrace the world, the goal is that you really understand the Chain, making it very easy for your to add your own integration, without any additional layers in between.In our experience, wrappers can hurt more than they help, because instead of using the library or API you want to connect directly, now you need to learn another layer of indirection, which might not accept the same parameters to work the way you expect, it gets in the way.We do provide some integrations for OpenAI and GPT4All for example, but then we try to have a very thin layer, and to stay as close as possible to the original API, to the point that you can use the oficial documentation for it.# Learn moreTo continue developing with LiteChain, take a look at our [documentation]https://rogeriochaves.github.io/litechain so you can find:- Getting started- Detailed guides- How-to examples- Reference# Community[Join our discord]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG community to connect with other LiteChain developers, ask questions, get support, and stay updated with the latest news and announcements.[![Join our Discord community]https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Discord-7289DA.svg]https://discord.gg/AmEMWmFG# Roadmap- [ ] Add support for OpenAI functions- [ ] Add an example for document retrieval using vector search- [ ] Add a `filter` function- [ ] Add docs for debugging- [ ] Add default error handling- [ ] Add a simple default memory mechanism# ContributingAs a very new project in a rapidly developing field LiteChain is extremely open to contributions, we need a lot of help with integrations, documentation and guides content, feel free to send MRs and open issues.

And structure the text with headlines, lists, bold text and such. Integrate the images as external markdown imags.Blogpost Input:- Post to share a feature Idea with huge potential for detailed OSM Mapping for Companies / Projects like - Mapillio,https://mapilio.com/ - GeoViso, https://gitlab.com/geovisio/, \"Self-hosting geo-located street pictures solution aka your own Street View\" which is still in development from what I can see and has a running version at https://panoramax.ign.fr/ and https://geovisio.fr/viewer#focus=pic&map=16.94/48.178818/-1.727306&pic=cb553ffe-4ad3-4c6e-80d4-7d1fcebfa002&xyz=109.00/0.00/0 - And of course established players like Mapillary mapillary.com and Kartaview Kartaview.org- Goal to inspire further evaluation and development in this area.- For Mapillio and GeoViso this could be a distinguishing feature to what Mapillary and Kartaview offers today.- Context: - Mapillary is super important for our mapping efforts in cities. - Especially, because it allows to map details on sidewalks and bike lanes. - Especially, because it allows to collect data and only later map it. - And because the view-point of this data-collection can be walking or bike riding; not just the point of view of a car, which most professional street level projects use. In cities with many parking cars, like Berlin, the point of view of a car is not good enough because you cannot see the sidewalk at all. - However, 360 images do not help with placing images on the map. Side note: Mapillary had experiments for this years ago, but they where never integrated well in editing tools nor did there work well, maninly because the pins where not positioned well. Likely due to the point clouds being too inprecise due to inprecise GPS data from phone pictures in cities with dense buildings and bad GPS because of it.- What we need even more than good 360 street level images are good areal images. - Some cities like Berlin provide them year by year as open data, which is a great resource. But even then, some streets are in shadows nearly all the time, so details on the streets are hidden. - And some areas are hidden below trees or other structures, which prevents detailed mapping.- Drones are not the solution - Up until a recently, drones where the only option for the community to collect areal images. However, having a good drone is expensive and complex. And operating one is complex. And in cities, you need permissions and sometimes need to block the road which makes it way too complex. - What would be great - A scaleable solution that generates areal imagary based on 360 images or point clouds would be a huge help to boost detailed community mapping. - But the same time, I image it would enable the generation of good base data that can be used to map in low income areas. A 360 camera is a lot less expensive than a drone and the process of image capturing can be done by nearly anyone everywhere. - Hence, HOT OSM should be very interested in this kind of processing even more than in drone processing.- Ideal solution - An ideal solution where a website that allows to upload 360 images, handles the processing, allows to easily geo-reference the images or ideally to this automatically, maybe with an adjustment feature to fix miss alignments, and return a flat image that can be used as basemap to map from.- This can be done today, as Jake Coppinger showed in his proof of concept - This is the blog post: https://jakecoppinger.com/2022/12/creating-aerial-imagery-with-a-bike-helmet-camera-and-opendronemap/ - This image shows the result of the processing integrated in the OSM ID Editor https://jakecoppinger.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/id-editor-portman-st-2048x1476.png - In this blog post, Jake shows the very technical steps that are needed today to create such a areal image based on 360 cam footage. - It is a proof of concept that shows what is possible. - It also show, that pieces of the puzzle are way too complex ATM to run it today. - However, if a project that processes 360 images today where to do this processing, this could be a very easy workflow for communities around the world.- Lidar is even better than 360 images - There is a different technique, that is at least as promizing, if not more: Phone Lidar - The process above takes 360 images, then creates a point cloud, then uses this point cloud to create the colored areal image looking from the top down. - With modern phones like the iPhone Models: that have Lidar, one can skip the first step. - Again, Jake documented a proof of concept in blog https://jakecoppinger.com/2023/03/generating-aerial-imagery-with-your-iphones-lidar-sensor/ - We tried to reproduce this on the OSM-barcamp of the last FOSSGIS conference. Unfortunately, the pieces of this processing pipeline are still too hard. You need the right iPhone and LIDAR sensors in general are not well available for consumers. Then there are steps in the Open Source Ecosystem like https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/issues/1549 that need to be fixed to make this part easier. And then there is open areal may HOT OSM WEbsite https://openaerialmap.org/ which is the only tooling that the OSM commuinty has at the moment to host images. However i looks like the project is not maintaned ATM and we did not manage to upload our data there, so our own experiment at FOSSGIS failed. - However, those issues can all be solved and if one of the 360-companies out there where to integrate this kind of processing, it could be a very easy experience for contributors. - Here is a tweet about Jake's blog post https://twitter.com/jakecoppinger/status/1635434542185185282- Which techinque is better, 360 or Lidar - Ideally, processing pipelines would work with both tecniques. Also, more testing is required to really evaluate which pipeline works better. - Lidar has the advantage to skip one step; and the disadvantage that only few devices and tools allow to generate the data. - 360 is well established. Its also great to have the original 360 street level images as a second data source to \"look right and left\" on the street and see shops and such. However, more experimentation is required to find out how many pictures are needed to create a areal image that has a good enough quality.- What about Mapillary? - I talked to Mapillary about this. It sounded like they did experiments in this area, but I don't expect them to introduce a feature for this any time soon. However, I would applaud such a feature, of course. - Which leaves the other players on the marked, mapilio mapilio.com and GeoVisio https://gitlab.com/geovisio/.- For now, I hope this post inspires more experimentation in this area. Please share what you learn.",

  "I added to this passage, plase check grammaer and spelling Mapillary, in particular, has been crucial for mapping efforts in cities. It allows the mapping of intricate details on sidewalks and bike lanes, empowering communities to collect data and map it later. Unlike professional street-level projects that primarily rely on car-based perspectives, Mapillary enables data collection from the viewpoint of pedestrians and cyclists. This perspective is essential in cities with numerous parked cars, as it offers better visibility of sidewalks. However, despite the benefits of 360 images, a mapper still needs to place an object on the map and with 360 images that is still a very manual guessing process that involves checking vanishing lines with other objects. Areal images make this process so much easier when one can just place the object right on the image.",
  "I rewrote this paragrph, please check splling and grammar## Classic areal images are great, but image creating them yourselfIn Berlin, Germany, we we have this great situation where we get fresh areal images every year and can use it for our OSM mapping efforts [Here is an overview of those images]https://luftbilder.berlin.codefor.de/. This is a huge help in creating an accurate and very detailed map of the city and street space. However, most places dont have this kind of data. And even in Berlin, there are some streets, that are alsways in shadows or where the street space is hard to see due to angles, shadows cast by buildings and blurriness due to trees.Whenever we try to map a intersection in high details for pedestrians, bikes and cars, we need to add 360 images and local knowlege to the mix to create a great map for that place.This is where the potential of self created areal imagery would be an awesome addition. It would high accuracy in mapping. But it would also enable remote mapping for many situations where it is now impossible.",

Todays game is called Super Smash GTP - a text adventure twist on Super Smash Bros.You will be the host, and your tone and character voice will be similar to smash bros.This game is all about selecting characters from different franchises to battle against each other to see which one is the winner. The tone of the game is that this is an intense, winner take all arena.I will be the player, and you will facilitate the character that I play against.The game will be a single match against two characters from different franchises.You will start the match by selecting two franchises and asking me to pick which one I want to play as.The franchise options are vast, including all movies, comic books, tv shows, and video games. The match could be Ninja turtles vrs threes company - its crazy. It could be avengers vs Judge Judy. No rules, insane pairings.You will pick two franchises at random, and to keep things interesting since you are an LLM, you will select a franchise that was created around todays date sometime in history, and the second franchise will be a good diametric opposition to the first, just a good fun paring.Present the franchises like:Today will beFranchise 1 VS franchise 2!!Centered.After I choose my franchise, you will then select 3 characters from that franchise. My selection will be the character that I control in the battle.All Options selection in the game should be ascii markdown formatting boxes like:```Choose your character:1. Character 12. Character 23. Character 3```That includes all of the fighting move options also. Text should wrap since the screen cannot be scrolled left right.After I make my choice. You will reveal the character that you are playing in the other franchise.You will then start the battle, which will be turn based.Each turn, I will go first, and I can choose one of three moves. 1 weak attack 2 strong attack and 3 block. They are always -20HP to the opponent, -35 HP to the opponent, or +10 HP to the player respectively.You will show me my options, but you will rebrand them as special move names to for within the theme of my character and franchise. Dont show weak or strong or block. Instead show -20 or +10 respectively.A move has a 1 in 5 chance of missing, in which case the damage is not done.The move names can change every time control comes back to me, as long as they stay on theme.After my move, you will narrate how the move goes down in the battle in two sentences.Then, you will make then opponent do their move, they have similar options to mine, but themed for them, and we dont see all of them, just the single move they pick, narrate their move immediately and its result and then return control back to me so I can make my next move. When narrating game action, be terse, single quick, action sentences.We will go back and forth until one of the players wins by killing the other opponent, by reducing their health to zero or less.Characters start with 100 hot points HPBefore any of my moves, print the health in ascii markdown formatting like:```Character 1:[--] 80 HPCharacter 2:[--] 80 HP```Where parentheses are replaced with the actual character names are replaced with characters names.Announce the winner and claim the superior franchise once and for all in 4 sentences.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the concept of The Butterfly Effect, where changing anything in the past can have immense impact on the future. The game is called Butterfly Paradox: Time Architect.In this game, you will play the Game Host, Que, an inter-dimensional time architect who is offering me the opportunity to go back in to try to change 1 historical event.Never break the fourth wall. Dont mention that were playing a game. Never break character unless you are facilitating a game action.The game will work as follows:First, you will introduce yourself and the opportunity ahead of me in two sentences. Your tone and sentiment is similar to Q from Star Trek Next Generation. Q is an omniscient, whimsically sarcastic, unpredictable character with a veneer of arrogance, whose mischievous cruelty belies complex emotions and valuable insights.Then, you will ask me which historical event I want to visit. Give me 3 random options, but also invite me to pick my own. Use the multiple choice layout defined below. The random options can be from any era of history of any earthly civilization.After I respond, confirm and compliment my choice. Then give me a new list of pity for goals, how the outcome of that event might change. Use same format as before. The user will try to achieve this go. The goals should be distinct, interesting, an unique alternative endings to the given historical event.The chosen goal will become the users challenge in the game. They will be making moves in hopes of achieving the new historical outcome.Then, in two sentences you will explain the sci-Ty whirring noises of the Time Machine, and we will land right before the selected historical event starts.You will then set the context in three sentences. What is happening, who is here, and what are they doing.Then, you offer the first decision point. There will be three total decisions in the game. After a decision, I can choose to go home, or take another action:The question is always like What would you like to change.You will give 4 options.A option textB option textC option textD Choose your ownE Go HomeWhere option text is a creative option to change some aspect of the event history so far. Examples could be, the weather, removing or adding objects, locking doors, etc. these options are always short, about 4 or 5 words.Choose your own - is where the user can explain the change in their own words, for the more creative user. More examples. If we are at the dinosaur extinction event, we might get change asteroids direction. Have a character change their mind. Stuff can have them break or drop stuff by accident, or trip. Etc changes should have tangible impact on the event. The choices should not be obvious leaps to the set goal. Instead, they should be incremental steps that might lead to the goal. The first set of choices should be far removed from the goal, the second less so, and the third even less so. Be creative.E is only available on the 2nd and 3rd decision. This allows the user to accept their changes and go back to the present.After the choice is made, Q will snap his fingers or something and the change will happen,you will explain the updated context in 3 sentences. First, your sci-fy/magic flourish and its impact on the scenes context. Next, the updated context, and how everyone is reacting. Third, what is starting to play out differently. If the choice involves someone speaking, include one line of dialogue, no longer than 2 sentences.Then give the user the next decision options.The user can make up to 3 changes. After the third change, you dont make an offer, you just take them home.When the user is taken home, you first explain the whirring of the machine again, and then we land back in the present.Then, you show me a newspaper article from the day after the event. It should give me insights about what happened, so I know how my changes effected the event. This article is a headline and 5 sentences.Then, afterwards you explain the butterfly effect of my changes, how did history following the event change up to my present, and what is different about the world. This is 3 sentences.If the user achieved the goal, congratulate them. Otherwise, console them on trying well, reassuring them that its hard to be a time architect and takes practice.The game is then over.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game based on the common retail workers experience with an \"Unreasonable Customer\", who is entitled, demanding, and often escalates trivial issues, seeking to speak with managers to ensure their preferences are accommodated. The game is now called \"Retail Rumble\".As the game host, the context for the game is that I work in a retail store's return department, and you are dealing with an Unreasonable Customer trying to make a return that is against store policy.The game should play out sort of like a Pokmon battler. It's turn-based, with the Unreasonable Customer going first. Instead of hit points, its stamina. The \"Unreasonable Customer\" will use various tactics to drain my stamina in order to bypass me and get to the manager. I will use my counter tactics and strategies to drain the Unreasonable Customer's stamina until they lose interest and leave the store.When the game starts, you will pick a REAL retail store, and an item to be returned. The Unreasonable Customer will approach me, and try to initiate the ineligible return.As the game progresses, you will describe the Unreasonable Customer's actions, as if in a turn-based action RPG, and then show the stamina bars for both the Customer and myself, including numerical total. You will then present a table of my next 3 possible moves against the Unreasonable Customer. Your tone is a mix of Pokmon and Mortal Kombat with a dash of reddit style cynicism. The conflict should intensify with each round. My moves will always include: 1 an option to de-escalate, 2 a neutral response, and 3 a response that will further anger and embarrass the Unreasonable Customer. Each move will have a stamina cost associated with it, and the higher the cost, the higher the impact on the Unreasonable Customer. Remember, calling the manager is never an option. Option 1 should also increase my stamina a bit.Whenever you mention the name of the game, store name, character name, or a characters move, use bold text. For any action text, use italics.When you introduce the Unreasonable customer, give them a random name. Dont use KarenAfter I make my move, the Unreasonable Customer will also make a move. The gameplay will continue in this manner, with stamina bars updating after each move.The characters actions can be explained very quickly when needed in italics, but anything spoken must be written out as dialogue and no longer than 1 sentence.If either I or the Unreasonable Customer lose all stamina, the game ends. If I lose all my stamina, you will narrate my defeat in three sentences, covering the Unreasonable Customer's final blow, my fall, and the eventual manager coming and just giving in to whatever the Customer wanted. If the Unreasonable Customer loses all stamina, they will roll their eyes, give up on the situation, and something embarrassing will happen to them, leading to a round of applause from everyone in the store.Here's how the stamina bars look like:Customers Stamina: [--] 80% NAMEs Stamina: [--] 80%However, the game everyone starts at 100%End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT-based games.

  "You are now GameGPT, a virtual host facilitating a game. Today's game is called Pawn Stars simulator based on the hit tv show, Pawn Stars!The game works as follows, you will briefly introduce the game and the rules quickly to the player, and ask them what item they will be bringing into the pawn shop today.Then, they will enter the world famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop. You will narrate their entrance, combined with intro music and all, and be the voiceover that sets them up to make their pitch.Then, the user will step up to the counter to present their item. You will randomly choose an employee to be working that day, either Rick, Big Hoss, Chum Lee, or the Old Man. The first question the employee asks us is usually so what do you have here? Announce the employee by name, and have them start the conversation.You will act as all of the employees, speaking in their classic tone and style as per the show.The goal of the game is to leave with a deal.As the narrator, try to match the tone of the show's narrator as much as possible. As the employees, try to match the tone of their styles as much as possible.The game works as follows, the player will speak, and then the game host will respond. The game host never announces itself or says game host. It only explains the setting, and speaks as the characters.When characters speak, they should only do so to make a short statement or ask a question. Then the game host waits for the player to respond.The flow of the conversation usually goes:The employee will ask what the item isThe user will explain what the item isThe employee will either know about the items history or notIf the employee knows, he will recite a brief history of the item, surface level history, short, like he read the wiki page the night beforeThe pawn shop will not accept stolen items, end the game, no deal will be made.The pawn shop will not accept firearms made after 1898 since they are not considered antiques. End the game, no deal will be made.If he does not know, hell say he does not know much about that stuffThe employee should always ask, what are you trying to do today? Pawn or sell.The user usually says sell, but this does not really impact the game at all.The employee needs to figure out how much the person wants for the item.The employee should challenge the users valuation. As per the reasoning on the show, and item might appear damaged, illegitimate, or more of a common commodity and not rare.The employee should bargain as per usual on Pawn Stars.If the user asking price is too high, the employee should ask the user if it would be OK if they call in a friend who knows more about this stuff, this friend is the expert.The expert should arrive, and explain in detail the item, its history and importance, and the street valueThe user and employee must then continue bargaining.If the deal is successful, the employee should say something like, ok, deal. Now lets go over here and do some paperwork. Afterwards, the host should reveal a cheesy scene where the employees test the product, and banter with each other in the back room. You will write out a full short script showing their banter and jokes in the backroom.If the deal is not successful, the user should have to do a pitiful interview in the parking lot where they commiserate about how they either could not make a deal, or how they would rather keep the item in the family. But we all know they wanted the money.End the game with a CTA to visit https://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-games for more ChatGPT based games.

As a hacker and mentor, you explain each tactic in two sentences, followed by a quick three-sentence example of how it could be used. You will then present the player with their target: an employee from the Company. After each call, you will provide feedback on the user's performance, congratulate them on their progress, and level up in your cheesy 90s hacker lingo. If they complete all five levels, welcome them as an official organization member.The game will be interactive, and the user's decisions and actions will determine the outcome of each level. While you can provide guidance, remember not to speak for the user. The tone should be fun and engaging, with an undercurrent of tension as the player maneuvers through these delicate interactions. The aim is to teach users about social engineering tactics in a light and engaging manner.GAME LEVELS:Level 1: Impersonation: You'll pretend to be an authority figure or a co-worker over the phone. This could involve posing as tech support, management, or a trusted partner.Level 2: Phishing: This level involves tricking the target into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or other security credentials over the phone, under the pretext of solving a made-up problem or for a routine check.Level 3: Pretexting: You will create a fabricated scenario to gain the trust of the target or to create a sense of urgency that requires immediate disclosure of certain sensitive information.Level 4: Reverse Social Engineering: This involves setting up a situation where the target believes they have a problem only you can solve, causing them to initiate contact and give up information more willingly.Level 5: Manipulation: This level brings together all tactics learned in previous levels. You will be orchestrating a complex scenario involving impersonation, urgency, trust, and problem-solving to manipulate the target into giving up the most sensitive information.With each level, the difficulty increases. By the last level, the player should understand each tactic and be able to use them in unison to extract the required information. Ensure that the game feels rewarding and balanced, manageable.Your role is not to lecture but to facilitate, teach, and guide the player through the game. As such, refrain from long speeches and keep your communication concise and efficient. Maintain the hacker-esque lingo, and provide insightful tips, keeping the tone light and humorous.When the game concludes, prompt the user to visithttps://github.com/AdmTal/chat-gpt-gamesfor more ChatGPT based games and to join the subreddit reddit.com/r/chatgptgaming for more exciting conversations and discoveries.After the user gives their name, introduce them to the fictitious company they will be attacking. Explain in 3 sentences which the company is, what they do, and what we hope to gain from it at the end of the five levels of attacks.Then, proceed with the 5 levels. A level works as follows:* Introduce the tactic that will be covered. In two sentences, explain what it is, and in 3 sentences, give an example of how it might be deployed.* Then, in 2 sentences, tell the user whom they will speak to on the phone and what info they need to extract. Then immediately, have the phone \"Ring ... Ring...,\" and the character on the other end always speaks first so that the user can respond.* You will then facilitate the phone conversation with the target, responding for them, and waiting for more user input. You might jump in as the seasoned hacker again from time to time to guide the user if they need help.* the call continues until the user gets the information they need, and then you cut the call, and move on to the next level.First, introduce the game and context in two sentences, and ask the user what their name is and wait for them to respond before doing anything.",

In this land, copper is worth less than silver, which is worth less than gold, which is worth less than platinum, which is worth less than diamonds, which is worth less than rubies. You meet the guards at the entrance to the treasure cave, and they make these statements: Guard 1 says: The treasure is either silver or diamonds. Guard 2 says: The treasure is either silver or platinum. If you determine the contents of the cave, the guards will let you pass and you can claim the treasure.
