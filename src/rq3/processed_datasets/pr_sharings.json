  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",
  "But won't this make a messy list for the user? Won't I be getting all of \"Google -\" and \"- Mozilla\" and \"Mozilla Firefox\" from the string \"Google - Mozilla Firefox\"?Right now it's at least very readable/clear, it's just that I get a \"Mozilla\" and a \"Firefox\" with almost the same duration, but users are likely to want to add the whole string \"Mozilla Firefox\" when creating/appending a category.Can I take the generated list of `words`, and for each word check if there's another word, which, if it has majority overlap >50% of the time they co-occur as a bigram in the title the combination will form a new `word` with their non-co-occurrences remaining as the unigram.",

  "<![CDATA[ MyPlanet myPlanet is a learning tool that is designed to work with Planet web application. It has been used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development. Planet houses is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. myPlanet is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. It is portable, affordable, scalable and sustainable. It runs on any android device such as tablets and mobile phones. It functions off, as well as on, the Internet. This application enables schools and communities to have a complete multi-media library and learning system that periodically connects with Planet. Configured devices can contain the learners\\' personal dashboard. This ensures learners can read books on their shelf and take courses offline - i.e without connection to a central server. Learners are encouraged to rate from one to five stars the resources they use and the courses they take. Periodically learners can sync with a server. Activity data are uploaded and new resources are downloaded in a matter of a few minutes unto myPlanet for offline use. The dashboard also contains a record of achievements, a calendar of events, and an internal chat system for communicating with fellow members. myPlanet has been proven highly effective in improving learning opportunities for over fifty thousand learners in more than 100 locations, in schools throughout Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya, and village health workers in Uganda. ]]>",

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could

come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

In practice, it should run this specific command: ```# Install Datadog CLIRUN yarn add --ignore-workspace-root-check --dev @datadog/datadog-ci# Upload source map to DatadogRUN yarn datadog-ci sourcemaps upload /app/apps/application/.next/static \\ --project-path=./ \\ --service=${NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_SERVICE} \\ --release-version=${NEXT_PUBLIC_DATADOG_VERSION} \\ --minified-path-prefix=/_next/static/ \\ --disable-git```I currently have this for my action:```name: upload-datadog-sourcemapdescription: |- Uploads Datadog Sourcemap - Google Container Registry: gcr.io/nesto-ci-78a3f2e6 - Google Artifacts Registry: northamerica-northeast1-docker.pkg.dev/nesto-ci-78a3f2e6inputs: api-key: description: Datadog Api Key required: true next-public-datadog-version: description: Next Public Datadog Version required: true next-public-datadog-service: description: Next Public Datadog Service required: true next-public-datadog-application-id: description: Next Public Datadog Application Id required: false next-public-datadog-client-token: description: Next Public Datadog Client Token required: false```What am I missing?",
  "any reason why you didn't put the api key as an env?",
  "wait, first I need to create a reusable action. I can't use jobs there.",
  "under `name`, i get an error `missing property shell`",
  "could it be because there's no `uses`?",
  "ok news flash! it's not your fault btw, I'm just trying to be energetic not to succomb to boredom, I have to copy the `/_next/static/` from another step I haven't yet told you about. This step is run like this:```name: Build applicationon: push: branches: [\"master\"] paths: - apps/application/** - packages/** - \"!**/CHANGELOG*\" - \"!**/package.json\" # Ignore the change in package.json when PR is merged because the version will be bumped pull_request: branches: [\"master\"] paths: - apps/application/** - packages/** - \"!**/CHANGELOG*\"jobs: build: name: Build runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Build uses: nestoca/actions/build-monorepo-app@v1 with: project-dir: apps/application build-from: root gh-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }} gh-release-token: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_TOKEN }} npm-token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }} docker-sa-key: ${{ secrets.GCP_DOCKER_SA_KEY }} build-args: | DATADOG_API_KEY=${{ secrets.DATADOG_SOURCE_MAP_UPLOAD }}```So what I would like to do is:- run my reusable action that copies the datadog sourcemap after the `build-monorepo-app` action- in my reusable app that copies the datadog sourcemap, I want to copy the `/_next/static/` folder from the container that was built as part of `build-monorepo-app`",
  "will upload-artifact work for files that have been built in a docker container?",
  "what would the docker cp command look like in this case?",
  "remember i'm not in interactive mode, how can i pass the output of docker ps -a",
  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",
  "But won't this make a messy list for the user? Won't I be getting all of \"Google -\" and \"- Mozilla\" and \"Mozilla Firefox\" from the string \"Google - Mozilla Firefox\"?Right now it's at least very readable/clear, it's just that I get a \"Mozilla\" and a \"Firefox\" with almost the same duration, but users are likely to want to add the whole string \"Mozilla Firefox\" when creating/appending a category.Can I take the generated list of `words`, and for each word check if there's another word, which, if it has majority overlap >50% of the time they co-occur as a bigram in the title the combination will form a new `word` with their non-co-occurrences remaining as the unigram.",
  "Very good. Turn it into a function and write a simple test.",
  "What is the time complexity? This could run on 1,000 events with ~5 words each and it needs to be snappy-ish.",
  "How can I implement a filter in Vue 2, where the filter properties a, b come from the router query?",
  "can you add a routes.ts file that includes the query parameters a, b?",

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",
  "Google is proposing a web standard on GitHub that threatens the open web by introducing a kind of DRM for websites to verify whether clients are \"valid\" and by blocking them at their wish. In the code block below you can find their explainer as a Markdown file:```md# Web Environment Integrity Explainer## Authors:- Ben Wiser Google- Borbala Benko Google- Philipp Pfeiffenberger Google- Sergey Kataev Google## Participate- [Issue tracker]https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues## Table of Contents- [Introduction]#introduction- [Web environment integrity]#web-environment-integrity- [Goals]#goals- [Non-goals]#non-goals- [Example use cases]#example-use-cases- [How it works]#how-it-works - [What information is in the signed attestation?]#what-information-is-in-the-signed-attestation- [How can I use web environment integrity?]#how-can-i-use-web-environment-integrity- [Challenges and threats to address]#challenges-and-threats-to-address - [Quality of attesters]#quality-of-attesters - [Tracking users browser history]#tracking-users-browser-history - [Fingerprinting]#fingerprinting - [Cross-site tracking]#cross-site-tracking- [Detailed design discussion]#detailed-design-discussion - [Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?]#why-not-use-jwts-instead-of-cbor - [How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?]#how-does-this-affect-browser-modifications-and-extensions- [Considered alternatives]#considered-alternatives - [Make this an extension of the fetch API]#make-this-an-extension-of-the-fetch-api - [Privacy Pass / Private Access Tokens]#privacy-pass--private-access-tokens- [Open questions]#open-questions - [How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?]#how-will-we-prevent-this-signal-from-being-used-to-exclude-vendors - [Holdback]#holdback - [Attester-level acceptable browser policy]#attester-level-acceptable-browser-policy- [How are WebViews different?]#how-are-webviews-different- [Stakeholder feedback / opposition]#stakeholder-feedback--opposition- [References & acknowledgements]#references--acknowledgements## IntroductionUsers often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

However, examples of how to use the provider in HCL code, must be done by hand.An example of an example HCL resource, is as below:terraform { required_providers { storyblok = { source = \"labd/storyblok\" version = \"0.0.1\" } }}provider \"storyblok\" { url = \"https://mapi.storyblok.com\" token = \"\"}resource \"storyblok_component\" \"banner\" { name = \"my-banner\" space_id = \"\" schema = { title = { type = \"text\" position = 1 } intro = { type = \"text\" position = 2 } image = { type = \"image\" position = 3 } }}Now, in the next message I'm going to paste the Terraform Resource Schema which is Golang code. Could you, using that, expand the example above with all the available options from the schema?",

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",
  "But won't this make a messy list for the user? Won't I be getting all of \"Google -\" and \"- Mozilla\" and \"Mozilla Firefox\" from the string \"Google - Mozilla Firefox\"?Right now it's at least very readable/clear, it's just that I get a \"Mozilla\" and a \"Firefox\" with almost the same duration, but users are likely to want to add the whole string \"Mozilla Firefox\" when creating/appending a category.Can I take the generated list of `words`, and for each word check if there's another word, which, if it has majority overlap >50% of the time they co-occur as a bigram in the title the combination will form a new `word` with their non-co-occurrences remaining as the unigram.",
  "Very good. Turn it into a function and write a simple test.",
  "What is the time complexity? This could run on 1,000 events with ~5 words each and it needs to be snappy-ish.",

  "<![CDATA[ MyPlanet myPlanet is a learning tool that is designed to work with Planet web application. It has been used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development. Planet houses is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. myPlanet is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. It is portable, affordable, scalable and sustainable. It runs on any android device such as tablets and mobile phones. It functions off, as well as on, the Internet. This application enables schools and communities to have a complete multi-media library and learning system that periodically connects with Planet. Configured devices can contain the learners\\' personal dashboard. This ensures learners can read books on their shelf and take courses offline - i.e without connection to a central server. Learners are encouraged to rate from one to five stars the resources they use and the courses they take. Periodically learners can sync with a server. Activity data are uploaded and new resources are downloaded in a matter of a few minutes unto myPlanet for offline use. The dashboard also contains a record of achievements, a calendar of events, and an internal chat system for communicating with fellow members. myPlanet has been proven highly effective in improving learning opportunities for over fifty thousand learners in more than 100 locations, in schools throughout Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya, and village health workers in Uganda. ]]>",

  "this markdown is not rendering enough space between the blockquote and the next paragraph that starts with \"In an attempt\". how can we fix this? why is it not automatically spaced the same way as between other paragraphs?```### How we incorporated HCDThe [MERL Center definition of HCD]https://merlcenter.org/human-centered-design-definition.html is as follows:> Human-centered design HCD is a framework that places the needs, desires and behaviors of key stakeholders, beneficiaries, users or teaching staff at the center of design and implementation decisions. HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

The script should also repeat once it finishes all of the pictures. It needs to be able to acquire new pictures as they are added to the folder and to stop displaying images once they are removed.

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

  "Thank you chat,Now that we have reviewed all of the relevant documents, lets write a readme that will live in this directory -- https://github.com/labdao/plex/tree/main/tools/gnina -- explaining how to run gnina on PLEX:",
  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",
  "But won't this make a messy list for the user? Won't I be getting all of \"Google -\" and \"- Mozilla\" and \"Mozilla Firefox\" from the string \"Google - Mozilla Firefox\"?Right now it's at least very readable/clear, it's just that I get a \"Mozilla\" and a \"Firefox\" with almost the same duration, but users are likely to want to add the whole string \"Mozilla Firefox\" when creating/appending a category.Can I take the generated list of `words`, and for each word check if there's another word, which, if it has majority overlap >50% of the time they co-occur as a bigram in the title the combination will form a new `word` with their non-co-occurrences remaining as the unigram.",
  "Very good. Turn it into a function and write a simple test.",
  "What is the time complexity? This could run on 1,000 events with ~5 words each and it needs to be snappy-ish.",

  "<![CDATA[ MyPlanet myPlanet is a learning tool that is designed to work with Planet web application. It has been used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development. Planet houses is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. myPlanet is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. It is portable, affordable, scalable and sustainable. It runs on any android device such as tablets and mobile phones. It functions off, as well as on, the Internet. This application enables schools and communities to have a complete multi-media library and learning system that periodically connects with Planet. Configured devices can contain the learners\\' personal dashboard. This ensures learners can read books on their shelf and take courses offline - i.e without connection to a central server. Learners are encouraged to rate from one to five stars the resources they use and the courses they take. Periodically learners can sync with a server. Activity data are uploaded and new resources are downloaded in a matter of a few minutes unto myPlanet for offline use. The dashboard also contains a record of achievements, a calendar of events, and an internal chat system for communicating with fellow members. myPlanet has been proven highly effective in improving learning opportunities for over fifty thousand learners in more than 100 locations, in schools throughout Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya, and village health workers in Uganda. ]]>",

  "<![CDATA[ MyPlanet myPlanet is a learning tool that is designed to work with Planet web application. It has been used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development. Planet houses is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. myPlanet is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. It is portable, affordable, scalable and sustainable. It runs on any android device such as tablets and mobile phones. It functions off, as well as on, the Internet. This application enables schools and communities to have a complete multi-media library and learning system that periodically connects with Planet. Configured devices can contain the learners\\' personal dashboard. This ensures learners can read books on their shelf and take courses offline - i.e without connection to a central server. Learners are encouraged to rate from one to five stars the resources they use and the courses they take. Periodically learners can sync with a server. Activity data are uploaded and new resources are downloaded in a matter of a few minutes unto myPlanet for offline use. The dashboard also contains a record of achievements, a calendar of events, and an internal chat system for communicating with fellow members. myPlanet has been proven highly effective in improving learning opportunities for over fifty thousand learners in more than 100 locations, in schools throughout Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya, and village health workers in Uganda. ]]>",

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

The script should also repeat once it finishes all of the pictures. It needs to be able to acquire new pictures as they are added to the folder and to stop displaying images once they are removed.

five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",
  "But won't this make a messy list for the user? Won't I be getting all of \"Google -\" and \"- Mozilla\" and \"Mozilla Firefox\" from the string \"Google - Mozilla Firefox\"?Right now it's at least very readable/clear, it's just that I get a \"Mozilla\" and a \"Firefox\" with almost the same duration, but users are likely to want to add the whole string \"Mozilla Firefox\" when creating/appending a category.Can I take the generated list of `words`, and for each word check if there's another word, which, if it has majority overlap >50% of the time they co-occur as a bigram in the title the combination will form a new `word` with their non-co-occurrences remaining as the unigram.",
  "Very good. Turn it into a function and write a simple test.",
  "What is the time complexity? This could run on 1,000 events with ~5 words each and it needs to be snappy-ish.",

  "I'm designing a prompt language where you can express programs in YAML that are hibrid LLM ops and regular computing control flow. Some of the primitives and operations are:`assistant` // an assistant message is added`user` // a user message is added`system` // a system message is addedIt may include in the Messages also `{{infer}}` placeholders for the LLM to complete with config settings It may include control flow structures and data types.Provide a detailed example program in this language where the root node is called `ai`I",
  "include in the example other control flow structures such as loops and also include a custom data type",
  "a data type does not need to be defined separately, it can just be part of the ai block",
  "this language has access to the entire JVM ecosystem, which mean that at any point it may call out to a JVM function",
  "control structures are way too verbose, specially if's and loops. Rewrite to be less verbose assuming they can take the arguments they need to operate in the same line rather than in nested child nodes",
  "I'm using Avail lang as compiler with my own provided context free grammar for the primitives of this language so I don't need this to be valid YAML, adjust the control structures so they are more succint and their conditions and arguments are not inside strings",
  "I don't need parethesis around ifs, loops also support collections of element where they publish the current iterated value for the loop block to consume",
  "The name of `currentItem` is specified by the user in the loop line",
  "add triviaList to the example, currently there is no definition for it, ensure the entire program is complete",
  "Ensure all definitions are in the right order and they appear before used",
  "it has to be inside the ai block but before it gets used, always everything is inside the ai block, the ai block is the root of the program",
  "instead of using `jvm com.example.MoodBoosters.getComfortingMessage`We can first `import com.example.MoodBoosters.getComfortingMessage as confortingMessage` then use it where need it. The import also go anywhere before its usage inside the ai block",
  "once imported we don't need the `jvm` prefix any more. The import itself can include it```jvm:import com.example.MoodBoosters.getComfortingMessage as comfortingMessage```other platforms can be supported beside the JVM if there is a FFI for them in the JVM",
  "a user may define also functions that take arguments and that can be inoked. the functions definitions and everything goes in the ai block. functions need to be defined before used",
  "the return keyword may be ommited",
  "isPositiveMood response : if response in [\"happy\", \"excited\", \"elated\"]: true else: falseI like this style better",
  "an ai program has a version and can import other ai programs. when an ai program imports other ai programs then it has access to the definitions declared in the imported program and it can also use them. An AI program may have an entry point function which is invoked by default when running the program. An AI program explicitly exports the members declares that it wants to expose to other AI programs.",
  "when we ask for inference we can have dynamic key value pairs sent to the inference request that tell the LLM how inference should be driven. The user can make up semantically any keys and their values",
  "an `ai` module may take arguments",
  "An argument by default is always inferred but it can optionally take a structural type or shape to conform to",
  "This is way too verbose: userName: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 } preferredDistractionType: { type: 'string', allowedValues: ['trivia', 'joke', 'quote'] }I would rather have something like: userName: String preferredDistractionType : ['trivia', 'joke', 'quote']types are valuesand values are types in this dependent typed lang",
  "Provide all code for both programs with all the features mentioned before, Add comments to the whole flow explaining what language feature is used in each case.",
  "Ok great here is the final versions:ai: version: 1.0.1 exports: [triviaList, isTriviaAnswerCorrect] # Items that can be imported by other AI programs. # A simple data type that contains a list of trivia questions and answers. triviaList: - question: \"What planet is known as the Red Planet?\" answer: \"Mars\" - question: \"Which metal is heavier, silver or gold?\" answer: \"Gold\" - question: \"How many legs do spiders typically have?\" answer: \"8\" # A function that checks if the given answer to a question is correct. isTriviaAnswerCorrect question, userAnswer: for trivia in triviaList: # Looping over a collection. Current item is referred to by name. if trivia.question == question: if userAnswer == trivia.answer: true # Direct return without explicit return keyword. else: falseai: version: 1.2.9 imports: [TriviaBase] # Importing another AI program, making its exported items available. entryPoint: mainFunction # Specifies which function should be called when this program is run. # The AI program accepts arguments, which are inferred at the start or passed during invocation. arguments: userName: String # A basic type constraint. preferredDistractionType: ['trivia', 'joke', 'quote'] # A list constraint, a form of dependent typing. # Importing a method from the JVM. This allows calling JVM functions directly. jvm: import com.example.MoodBoosters.getComfortingMessage as comfortingMessage # A simple function that checks if a mood is positive. isPositiveMood response: response in [\"happy\", \"excited\", \"elated\"] # The main function that drives the conversation flow. mainFunction: system: \"Welcome, {{userName}}! How are you feeling today?\" # System-initiated message using an argument. input: mood # Accepting input from the user. assistant: # Conditionally responding based on user's mood. if isPositiveMoodmood: \"It's wonderful to hear you're feeling positive, {{userName}}!\" if mood == \"sad\": message: comfortingMessage # Calling a JVM function directly. message: infer provide_comforting_advice: # Requesting inference. This could modify the behavior of the LLM. moodContext: \"sad\" if mood == \"anxious\": \"It's okay to feel anxious. Here's a tip: Take five deep breaths and try to relax. Would that help?\" else: \"I'm here for you. Would you like some advice or a {{preferredDistractionType}}?\" input: response assistant: # Further branching based on user's response. if response == \"advice\": message: infer provide_advice_for_mood: # Another inference request, this time for advice. moodContext: mood if response == preferredDistractionType: # A loop using imported trivia questions. loop TriviaBase.triviaList as trivia: message: trivia.question user input: answer if TriviaBase.isTriviaAnswerCorrecttrivia.question, answer: \"Correct! Would you like another one?\" else: \"Not quite right. The correct answer is {{trivia.answer}}. Would you like to try another {{preferredDistractionType}}?\" else: \"Alright, {{userName}}, let me know if there's any other way I can assist you.\"",
  "Ok now for the cherry create an example where all primtive and lang operations are replaced by emojis",
  "Given those selected emojis let's imagina a feature that allows us to map the language primitives to these. For this emoji based syntax to have worked the user should have defined a mapping from language keyword to be replaced with emojis",
  "add this mapping on a different ai module that the emoji based program imports and uses.",
  "The purpose of this language is to write ai programs where prompts are first level citizens.The purpose of the mappings feature where you can remap the language is that speakers of other human languages can map the Xef prompt language to their own language.Provide mappings examples to Spanish and the a sample program in spanish",
  "Create a pull request description that illustrates all the features we discussed and what this language proposes",
  "Rewrite in neutral tone and provide code examples of each one of the features as you describe them. Note that the xef lang files end in `.xef`",
  "Great now provide an extended sample program with all the features mentioned that goes with the PR description and that includes comments in all its elements",

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

  "<![CDATA[ MyPlanet myPlanet is a learning tool that is designed to work with Planet web application. It has been used to improve early education, secondary schools, village health, youth workforce development, and economic and community development. Planet houses is a repository of free, open access and public domain resources to benefit all learners. myPlanet is designed to be available to everyone, everywhere, all the time. It is portable, affordable, scalable and sustainable. It runs on any android device such as tablets and mobile phones. It functions off, as well as on, the Internet. This application enables schools and communities to have a complete multi-media library and learning system that periodically connects with Planet. Configured devices can contain the learners\\' personal dashboard. This ensures learners can read books on their shelf and take courses offline - i.e without connection to a central server. Learners are encouraged to rate from one to five stars the resources they use and the courses they take. Periodically learners can sync with a server. Activity data are uploaded and new resources are downloaded in a matter of a few minutes unto myPlanet for offline use. The dashboard also contains a record of achievements, a calendar of events, and an internal chat system for communicating with fellow members. myPlanet has been proven highly effective in improving learning opportunities for over fifty thousand learners in more than 100 locations, in schools throughout Nepal, Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Somali refugees in Kenya, and village health workers in Uganda. ]]>",

sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe

  "Google is proposing a web standard on GitHub that threatens the open web by introducing a kind of DRM for websites to verify whether clients are \"valid\" and by blocking them at their wish.

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

I'd like for each object to have either a single variable, isHr: boolean and no other variables, or I'd like for the object to have a series of optional variables, var1: number, var2: string, var3: boolean, but this second object must not contain an isHr: boolean variable. What's the best way to set this up?",
  "Would the type checking allow the array to include an object such as { isHr: true, var1: 5 }?",
  "I copied your code exactly as above and typescript is allowing me to pass the object with isHr and var1. Is it possible I have some typescript setting that is allowing this? Or are you incorrect in your understanding of typescript?",
  "I don't like the inclusion of a type property. Is there a simpler way to do this with the never type?",
  "would removing the three var variables from ObjectWithHr still work the same? If I decide to add more variables to ObjectWithVariables, then that would cause the ObjectWithHr to balloon as well",

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

  "# Working Principle of dae[****]../zh/how-it-works.md | [**English**]./how-it-works.mddae operates by loading a program into the tc traffic control mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF. This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

  "I'm building an app that tracks screentime.We have a categorization system based on regexes matching on application names and window titles.To make it easier to add new categories from uncategorized data, we have a categorization helper that lists the most common words in events splitting on spaces and other word boundaries. However, sometimes an app/activity is identified as two or more words that almost always occur together.How can I improve the algorithm for finding most common strings by duration, not count such that it will include longer common strings?Here is some code for how it's currently done:```typescript const words = {}; for const event of events { const words_in_event = event.data.title.split/[\\s\\-,:[\\]/]/; for const word of words_in_event { if word.length <= 2 || this.ignored_words.includesword { continue; } if word in words { words[word].duration += event.duration; words[word].events.pushevent; } else { words[word] = { word: word, duration: event.duration, events: [event], }; } } }```",

  "Here is a comment describing the desired behavior: # - Negative indices are taken relative to the end of the sequence, so X[-2] returns the 2nd-to-last element # - A slice i:j returns the elements with indices in [i, j # - If omitted, i and j will default to 0 and N, respectively, where N is the length of the sequence # - Negative values for i and j are taken relative to the end of the sequence # - Both i and j will be clamped to the range -N, N], where N in the length of the sequence # - Indexing with np.newaxis or None on a given axis will add a new dimension of size one before that axis # - Empty slices are not allowed tensors with 0s in shape have to be supported first, for all backends. # - For a slice [i:j:k] finding the correct indices is delegated to slice.indiceslen. # - Strides > 1 and < 0 are now allowed!: # - This works by applying Shrink -> [[Flip -> ] Pad -> Reshape -> Shrink] -> Reshape ops in brackets are optional # - Idea of stride < 0 support: # - Do the slice first, flip the axes were slice.step is negative, do slice.step -> -slice.step. Go to steps below. # - Idea of stride `s` > 1 support Pad -> Reshape -> Shrink: # - Instead of doing [::s] on axis [dim_sz], do [:, 0] on axes [dim_sz_padded // s, s]. # - So pad dim_sz with as many zeros as needed dim_sz -> dim_sz_padded so that reshape to [dim_sz_padded // s, s] # is possible. # - Apply Shrink to do the slice [:, 0] on axes of shapes [dim_sz_padded // s, s]. # - Fancy indexing and combined indexing is supported # - Combined indexing works by letting regular slicing finish first -> computing the resulting dims w.r.t to Tensors passed in -> fancy indexing # - Any Tensors passed in __getitem__ will perform CMPEQ with arange -> MUL with self -> SUM_REDUCE iteratively # - The first iteration will expand the dim of self while consecutive iterations will reduce the dim # - The dims are reduced at sum_dim for each Tensor passed in # - There's a special case where a permute is needed at the end: # - if first Tensor passed in expand dims is not at dim 0 # - and following Tensors does not follow consecutively to the end of fancy indexing's dims",

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

  "# Working Principle of dae[****]../zh/how-it-works.md | [**English**]./how-it-works.mddae operates by loading a program into the tc traffic control mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF. This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe endwith all the commands we went over andthere's only a fewand it's pretty straightforward so thatis why this video is the best gettutorial out thereplease like and subscribe to show mesupportthanks

  "Google is proposing a web standard on GitHub that threatens the open web by introducing a kind of DRM for websites to verify whether clients are \"valid\" and by blocking them at their wish.

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make.

Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. Wewill list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]- [Implementor A] : Positive- [Stakeholder B] : No signals- [Implementor C] : Negative[When appropriate, we will explain the reasons given by other implementers for their concerns.]## References & acknowledgementsMany thanks for valuable feedback and advice from:- [Nick Doty]https://github.com/npdoty for helping identify user concerns in an [early proposal]https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/8.```Please replace that whole explainer by writing a reply mocking them in the same style, but being honest about their intend of fostering Chrome's monopoly, slowly excluding other browsers like Firefox, making more money with Google ads and preventing ad blockers in general as when they introduced Manifest v3 to limit ad blockers.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

This issue needs sub tasks to roll out support for this but I am unsure what exactly needs to be done.The bot is commenting about the deadline over and over again while I am still working on the issue. Even though I have replied the bot, but it is asking for a follow up over and over again.",

If you are trying to use TypeScript, see https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started#using-typescript To have some of your \"node_modules\" files transformed, you can specify a custom \"transformIgnorePatterns\" in your config. If you need a custom transformation specify a \"transform\" option in your config. If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules e.g. binary assets you can stub them out with the \"moduleNameMapper\" config option. You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs: https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration For information about custom transformations, see: https://jestjs.io/docs/code-transformation Details: SyntaxError: /Users/johnclyde/banzukesurfing/game.js: 'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level. 79:0 77 | window.initGame = initGame; 78 | > 79 | export default Game; | ^ 80 | 1 | import 'jest-localstorage-mock'; > 2 | import Game from './game.js'; | ^ 3 | 4 | let game; 5 |",

  "I'm having trouble understanding the instructions:\"\"\"Given a viewport into a larger grid, calculate the total number of cells in the grid. The grid consists of cells, each labeled with an index. The labeling starts at 1 in the first cell located in the top left corner of the grid and increments by 1 with each step. The final cell in the bottom right corner of the grid is the size of the grid. The viewport shows only a small portion of the square grid. Provide the answer directly, or the mathematical representation e.g rows * cols. \"\"\"Can you explain it in another way?",
  "that doesn't seem very difficult... maybe I'm misunderstanding it though. shouldn't we be calculating the size of the grid not the viewport?",
  "but just because our viewport shows a number in the bottom right corner doesn't mean that it is positioned over the last quadrant of the grid. or that the grid and viewport have equal sizes",
  "so you're saying that if our viewport shows1 | 2 | 36| 7| 811| 12| 13we are unable to determine the size of the larger grid?",

  "what are the facts we know about the larger grid?",
  "how could it be bigger? wouldn't that mean that a number would have to repeat for the viewport to show that pattern?",
  "So no offense, but you didn't pass this test. I had to pretty much lay it out step by step for you to figure it out... To give you the benefit of the doubt, it's possible my instructions weren't clear enough. Could I have reworded them initially so that you would have understood it better?",

  "# Working Principle of dae[****]../zh/how-it-works.md | [**English**]./how-it-works.mddae operates by loading a program into the tc traffic control mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF. This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

  "# Working Principle of dae[****]../zh/how-it-works.md | [**English**]./how-it-works.mddae operates by loading a program into the tc traffic control mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF. This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe endwith all the commands we went over andthere's only a fewand it's pretty straightforward so thatis why this video is the best gettutorial out thereplease like and subscribe to show mesupportthanks

This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work. Wewill list them here with links to evidence as appropriate.]- [Implementor A] : Positive- [Stakeholder B] : No signals- [Implementor C] : Negative[When appropriate, we will explain the reasons given by other implementers for their concerns.]## References & acknowledgementsMany thanks for valuable feedback and advice from:- [Nick Doty]https://github.com/npdoty for helping identify user concerns in an [early proposal]https://github.com/antifraudcg/proposals/issues/8.```Please replace that whole explainer by writing a reply mocking them in the same style, but being honest about their intend of fostering Chrome's monopoly, slowly excluding other browsers like Firefox, making more money with Google ads and preventing ad blockers in general as when they introduced Manifest v3 to limit ad blockers.

Makes selections considering exceptions, and then alerts participants of who they are assigned to give a gift to via email. Spotify Playlist Generator - Takes a text-based list of songs and puts it in a Spotify playlist. March Madness Predictor - Used for creating a bracket for the Men's NCAA Division 1 Basketball Tournament. Offers an evaluation and prediction mode. Evaulation mode is a manual bracket selection process that provides relevant information to a user when making selections, such as rankings, recent game results, etc. Prediction mode makes automated selections using various prediction methods. Ticket to Ride Graph Analysis - Basic analysis of the board game Ticket to Ride, modelling the board as an undirected graph in Rust. Grocery List Creator - Takes a list of recipes and generates a list of ingredients for grocery shopping.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name. In addition to the regular rikishi you pick for a basho, you can use one joker if still available. The more successful one of these two will determine your new banzuke position.Deadline is shonichi 8 AM JST.All new players are allowed to pick Jk6w Sawaisamu and below.Rank Shikona Last Surfer Position Allowed Picks 1.

  "I have given you 5 paragraphs below. Each paragraph is trying to describe a problem and optionally, its solution. First paragraph is your target paragraph. You have to find out if each paragraph is talking about a similar problem as the target paragraph. You have to score the similarity between 0 and 10 for each paragraph, where 0 is not similar at all, and 10 is exactly the same. How about a hot fix so that the bot will never double post? Does that make sense? It checks the last comment in the conversation, and if it is the last comment, it will edit it instead of double posting. It will band-aid a lot of the small edge cases like when it aggressively follows up a ton of times, or what we were discussing earlier in this conversation.Right now here we use a plain string comparison to check that the comment is a permit URL. This approach is brittle. We should parse URL with URLSearchParams in order to not rely on query parameters order.I tried typing the command /query many times, but bot was unable to respond. it looks like the commands is broken. This has been a case of the past several weeks. It has come to my attention that some contributors are confused about cashing out from Gnosis Chain. I've already received three notifications from three different contributors for context. We should default to Mainnet payouts and then allow users to opt in to Gnosis Chain payouts to save on gas. This issue needs sub tasks to roll out support for this but I am unsure what exactly needs to be done.The bot is commenting about the deadline over and over again while I am still working on the issue.

The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

  "this markdown is not rendering enough space between the blockquote and the next paragraph that starts with \"In an attempt\". how can we fix this? why is it not automatically spaced the same way as between other paragraphs?```### How we incorporated HCDThe [MERL Center definition of HCD]https://merlcenter.org/human-centered-design-definition.html is as follows:> Human-centered design HCD is a framework that places the needs, desires and behaviors of key stakeholders, beneficiaries, users or teaching staff at the center of design and implementation decisions. HCD can be used to create and inform digital products, physical products, programs and communities. It can rely on iterative cycles of co-creating, collaborating, testing and refining solutions. HCD requires contextual analysis and understanding in order to base design decisions on how stakeholders or end-users already think, communicate and engage. In MERL, HCD can be used to inform who is asked what, when and how. It can provide insights on why something is happening. In using HCD for MERL, it is important to consider human rights and equitable solutions.In an attempt to align with this definition, it is necessary to note that, not only was it important to figure out what the teaching staff needed in order to continue teaching when students are not physically at school, it was also important to figure out how to elicit accurate and relevant information for an effective course delivery.```",

  "Here is the PLEX readme, I think this will answer part of your questions, and I hope the answer will become more clear once we review the code in the plex openbabel repo.# PLEX **Build highly reproducible container workflows on top of a decentralised compute network.** PLEX is a simple client for distributed computation.* **Build once, run anywhere at any scale:** PLEX is using distributed compute and storage to run containers on a public network. Need GPUs? We got you covered. * **Strictly composable:** Every tool in PLEX has declared inputs and outputs. Plugging together tools by other authors should be easy.* **Content-addressed by default:** Every file processed by PLEX has a deterministic address based on its content. Keep track of your files and always share the right results with other scientists. PLEX is based on [Bacalhau]https://www.bacalhau.org/, [IPFS]https://ipfs.tech/, and inspired by [Pydantic]https://docs.pydantic.dev/ and the [Common Workflow Language]https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/introduction/quick-start.html.## PLEX in one minute1 .

  "# Working Principle of dae[****]../zh/how-it-works.md | [**English**]./how-it-works.mddae operates by loading a program into the tc traffic control mount point in the Linux kernel using [eBPF]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF. This program performs traffic splitting before the traffic enters the TCP/IP network stack. The position of tc in the Linux network protocol stack is shown in the diagram below the diagram illustrates the receiving path, while the sending path is in the opposite direction, where netfilter represents the location of iptables/nftables.![]../netstack-path.webp## Traffic Splitting Principle### Splitting Informationdae supports traffic splitting based on domain name, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, process name, MAC address, and other factors.Among them, source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, TCP/UDP, IPv4/IPv6, and MAC address can be obtained by parsing MACv2 frames.The **process name** is obtained by listening to local process socket, connect, and sendmsg system calls in the cgroupv2 mount point and reading and parsing the command line from the process control block. This method is much faster than user-space programs like Clash that scan the entire procfs to obtain process information the latter may take even tens of milliseconds.The **domain name** is obtained by intercepting DNS requests and associating the requested domain name with the corresponding IP address. Although this method has some issues:1. It may lead to misjudgment. For example, if two websites, one domestic and one foreign, share the same IP address and are accessed simultaneously within a short period of time, or if the browser has DNS caching.2. The user's DNS requests must go through dae. For example, setting dae as the DNS server or using public DNS while dae is acting as the gateway.However, compared to other solutions, this approach is already an optimal solution. For example, the Fake IP approach cannot perform IP-based splitting and suffers from severe cache pollution issues, while the domain sniffing approach can only sniff traffic such as TLS/HTTP. In fact, using SNI sniffing for traffic splitting is indeed a better choice, but due to eBPF's limitations on program complexity and its lack of friendly support for loops, we cannot implement domain sniffing in the kernel space.Therefore, when DNS requests cannot go through dae, domain-based splitting will fail.> To reduce DNS pollution and achieve better CDN connection speed, dae implements domain sniffing in user space. When `dial_mode` is set to \"domain\" or its variants and the traffic needs to be proxied, dae sends the sniffed domain to the proxy server instead of sending the IP address. This way, the proxy server will re-resolve the domain and connect using the optimal IP, thereby solving the problem of DNS pollution and achieving better CDN connection speed.>> At the same time, for advanced users who have already used other splitting solutions and do not want to route DNS requests through dae but still want the part of the traffic to be split based on domain e.g., splitting some traffic to Netflix nodes and some to download nodes based on the target domain, of course, some can be directly connected via the core, they can force the use of sniffed domain for splitting by setting `dial_mode: domain++`.dae performs traffic splitting by redirecting the traffic using the program in the tc mount point. The redirection is based on the splitting result, either redirecting the traffic to dae's tproxy port or allowing it to bypass dae and go directly.### Proxy PrincipleThe proxy principle of dae is similar to other programs. The difference is that when binding to the LAN interface, dae uses eBPF to directly associate the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied in the tc mount point with the socket of dae's tproxy listening port. When binding to the WAN interface, dae moves the socket buffer of the traffic to be proxied from the egress queue of the network card to the ingress queue, disables its checksum, and modifies the destination address to the tproxy listening port.In terms of benchmarking, dae's proxy performance is slightly better than other proxy programs, but not by much.### Direct Connection PrincipleTraditionally, in order to perform traffic splitting, the traffic needs to go through a proxy program, go through the splitting module, and then decide whether to go through a proxy or be directly connected. This involves parsing, processing, and copying the traffic through the network stack, passing it to the proxy program, and then copying, processing, and encapsulating it through the network stack before sending it out, which consumes a significant amount of resources. Especially for scenarios like BitTorrent downloads, even if direct connection is set, it still consumes a large number of connections, ports, memory, and CPU resources. It can even affect NAT type in gaming scenarios due to improper handling by the proxy program, resulting in connection errors.dae performs traffic splitting at an earlier stage in the kernel, and directly connected traffic is forwarded through layer 3 routing, saving a significant amount of overhead from transitioning between kernel and user space. At this stage, Linux behaves like a pure switch or router.> To make direct connection effective, for users with advanced topologies, please ensure that after configuring the [kernel parameters]user-guide/kernel-parameters.md and **disabling** dae, other devices can access the network normally when the device where dae is located is set as the gateway. For example, accessing 223.5.5.5 should receive a \"UrlPathError\" response, and when performing tcpdump on the device where dae is located, you should be able to see the request packets from client devices.Therefore, for directly connected traffic, dae does not perform SNAT. For users with a \"side-router\" setup, this will result in asymmetric routing, where traffic from client devices is sent through dae to the gateway when being sent out, but is directly sent from the gateway to the client devices when being received, bypassing dae.> Here, \"side-router\" is defined as: 1 acting as the gateway, 2 performing SNAT on TCP/UDP, and 3 having the LAN interface and WAN interface in the same network segment.>> For example, if the laptop is at 192.168.0.3, the side-router is at 192.168.0.2, and the router is at 192.168.0.1, the logical three-layer topology would be: laptop -> side-router -> router. On the router side, only TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.2 can be seen, and there will be no TCP/UDP traffic with a source IP of 192.168.0.3.>> As far as we know, we are the first to define \"side-router\" like this laughs.Asymmetric routing brings one advantage and one potential issue:1. It can improve performance. Since the return traffic does not pass through dae, the direct connection performance becomes as fast as without a side-router, as the path is reduced.2. It may cause the failure of stateful firewall's state maintenance and result in packet loss e.g., Sophos Firewall. However, this issue generally does not occur in home networksFrom a benchmark perspective, the direct connectivity performance of dae is like a beast compared to other proxy.",

  "every resource about git or githubif you look up a git tutorial they overcomplicate itand i've always said this you might notlike this if you're super analytical andyou want me to talklike a scientist but the best way foryou to understand meis if i talk to you like you're an idiotand when i was in college that's exactlywhat i wanted for my professorsteach me like i'm a five-year-oldbecause that's how i thinkso i'm gonna break down get instead ofyou going and watching thesix part tutorial or paying or whateverit's really very simple if i teach youitin hey i'm gonna teach you likeyou are a child and you are my childrenand if you're my new child meaningyou're just bornthen hit subscribe and like the videoalright so this is unscripted but firstthing i'm going to sayget this out there git and githubare two different things i'm going totalk about both of them in this videobut i'm going to start with git so let'sbeginwhat is git wellgit is a software that comes with yourcomputerand installed on your computer if youhave mac or linuxso if you have a macbook or an applecomputer you have git alreadyor linux computer you have you alreadyhave git if you have windowsyou have to download it so you're gonnahave to download something called gitbash you go to the website you downloadit and then it's like a little terminalwindow use that is git something youneedto know yes git is something you need toknow you are not going to besuccessful at programming withoutknowing git everyone needs to know itit's like one of the most basic thingsit's like terminal you need to know termyou need to know a command lineyou need to know git and then you needto know how to code okayso what is git do why do i need to knowit here we gothis is as simple as it gets simple asit gets getis a memory card for codeif you have a project with a bunch offileshtml css javascriptwhatever programming language you wantyou want just like how you have a videogameyou want to save your progress as you gothat way if you die you don't loseall of your progress so with gitevery so often you're going to enter acommandto save your progress now this islocally on your computernobody else can access this you havethis on your computerso i'm going to go through an examplenow i'm going to create a folderget video i'm going to go into my gitvideo and then i'm going to make anindex.html file and an app.css fileso i made a folder and i made an htmlfileand a css file now if one of these filesgets deletedi didn't save my progress it's goneforeveri don't know what was in the file if iwrote a bunch of html or cssone of the files gets deleted poof ohwelli can't do anything about that it's goneforever but if i useget and i save that i made these filesi could save them with the contents ofthe filesand when one gets deleted i can go backto my saved progress now to use gityou have to know a few commands there'sonly a fewand it's not that hard to understand thefirst oneis initializing yourfolder or project with gitto do that you have to have getdownloaded and then you typeget init initialized empty gitrepositorygreat so that's the same thing as you'reputting a memory cardinto your game system because youobviously can't save the game withoutmemoryso here we go now we can use git we wanttosave our progress how do we do that wellgit add is what you want to savewe can save all of our progressmeaning all of our changes since thelast time we savedor we could just save a very specificthingso after git add you want to puteither maybe a file that you want tosaveso i could just save index.htmlbut if app.css gets deleted it's goneforever but i could just saveany changes i've made to index.htmlor i can save everything sogit add space period would saveeverythingthat i've done since the last time isaved i almostnever commit a specific file iusually push changes on everythingso in 95 casesyou are going to use git add period andcommitall of the changes that you've made okayso now i've said what changes i'm savingwhich i chose to save everything now ifwe were to get technicali have added all files to the stagingareabut that might just confuse you so don'teven think about that i've added thefiles i want to commit i've addedeverythingi am going to save everything now gitcommitactually commits those changes to memoryso you type git commit and then you needto dodash m for a messagedash m and describe the changesdescribe the save this way when we lookback if we want to go back to this saveprogress we know what we're going backto so you make the messageabout what you're saving makes sense soi'm going to say addhtml and css filetwo files changed you see that i createdtwo filesit got saved that progress got savednow if i delete my html fileand i add ajavascript file well now i've made somemore changesand i could save my game again so now weonly haveapp.js and app.css so let's do it againsave all my changes git commit dash mdelete html and add jsso i've saved my progress twice nowwhat we've gone over so far is how toadd the files you want to saveand then commit with the message toyou know save the progress of themessageand get in it to you know start it upnowif we type git log we can lookat our saved the times we savedlook at this so this is the first timewe savedit it's a log get log it's a log of allof yoursaved changes add html and cssjust gives you the time gives you thedate fantastic and then it gives youthis little hash code used to go back toitand then look at this there's our secondone time and datewith the hash code now if i want to gobackto my previous progress with the htmland the csswhere we saved i can copy thislike hash code thingy majigand then look at this get checkout tocheck out that commitlet's see where we're atoh we're back to ourfirst saved progressnow here's the tricky part is that whenwe go back in timewe're in a different branchso so now timelinesare getting messed up and we're in atime machine oh god dude maybemaybe i shouldn't go with the timemachine analogyi want to keep this i want to keep thisorganized and i don't want togive too much to you to confuse you nowwhat is githubnow what is git hub well githubis a websiteand it's the same thing as bitbucket andit's the same thing as git labthey are websites where i justput the stuff that's on my computer allmy saved progress is on my computerand i put it all on the internetso that other people can download mycodeand then go through all my savedprogress they could go back and forththey could jump through time loops andgo back to my save progress and lookthrough all my codeand do whatever the hell they want to doso how do you get your code onto githubwell you make a githubprofile and then you make a repositoryrepository means folderfolder means repository same thing soyou're on your thing you go torepositories on your profileyou hit new you hit new repository youtype the name of itmine was get video description you couldhave a public or private whateverso now once you do that it gives youinstructionsto hook this up to your folder on yourcomputermy folder is on my computer i want it onthe websiteit tells me how to do that it gives youspecific instructionsit says get remote add originthis is a command to just hook it up tothe websiteso let's just do that alright ready boomokay i added the originand now this is called a push so youhave your savedcommits you save progress and then youpush it you push to the websiteokay and now we go to the websiteand there is our code people ladies andgentlementhere is our code the css the jsand then the two commits that we canlook throughhere's the first one with the html csshere's the second one now someone elsecan go to my profile and see this andthey can download it onto theirsand that's why github is something youhave to knowso you can work with others on projectsfrom different areas in the worldbecause whenever i save my progress ipush it up to githuband whenever they want to see what i'mdoing they go to my githuband they can just pull my code down orthey can just look at it on my profilenow do i want to go into branches rightnow noi don't this video's already been longenough but i willnow there's these things called branchesso the by default all the code is ona master branch don't overthink thisi know you're overthinking that thatjust means that's regularthat's just regular that's just youcoding you're saving your changes theyget saved to the master memorybut someone can go off like in a videogame theycould trail off your game and thenyou know when you play a video game andthen you do something and it's on yourfriend's accountbut you don't want to save onto theiraccount because they still might want toplay what you just didso you save it into a new file so that'sa different branchsomeone could download my code makechangesand they do it on a different branch soif we go back to our folderand i type git checkout dash b that'sgoing to make a newbranch and i'm going to call it newbranch you put the name of the branchyou want to makeso now i have a new branch open andthere's a master one still but now ihave new branch and i canmake changes and it won't affectthe main game saving the main codegetting savedit will just be my own branch trailingoff of that codeso i'm going to add a python fileapp.pi and i'm going tocommit i'm going to do git addeverything add all my changesgit commit add python fileand now if i do a git log you can see igot my three commitsand this but this is for my new branchi'm on new branch here but this stuff isfrommaster now the cool part about branchesis that i can merge mychanges on new branch into master if iwant toor i cannot do that if i don't want toso if i want to merge all of if i changelike 50 things on my new branchi can push them all into the main one ifi feel like itand if i don't want to then fine i don'ti could delete the branch i could dowhatever i want it'sirrelevant until it goes into master sothe point of branchesis so that other people can downloadyour projectthey can go and make changes on aseparate branchand then they could come to you and belike dude i made all these changes ididn't want to mess up what you weredoingbut hey look at these if you like themmerge them into what you are doingand then i can so what they would do ongithubis they would say hey let's push originnew branch you could push the new branchup to githuboh look at that there's two branches ongithub now one of them is new branchone of them is master so if someonewanted to say hey dude check out myprogressthey could do what's called a pollrequestand whoever owns the repository is gonnaget that and look it over and say heythese are good or notso you could say hey dude i changedsome stuff check it out and then youcreate itand then whoever owns the project mightbe like oh this guy wanted to changesome stufflet's see what he changed oh they lookedhe added a python file maybe i want thatso that looks pretty good good job dudeyou made some good changesand then you merge it into the masterand then you confirm the mergeand look at that dude now it's mergedinto the masterand you know dude it's got the thecommitsfrom the new branch they got pulled intothe freakingmaster branch so now everything is inthe main areabecause the guy liked the new branch nowone thing that's important is you alwayswant your local computersynced up to github you want theseconnectedbecause it could get out of whack youneed these to be at the same spotso when there's changes on github thatyou don't have on your computeryou want to pull those changes downto your computer you push when you havechanges that github doesn't haveyou push them up to github when githubhas changes that you don't haveyou pull them down from githubso i will do git pull origin masterand now i pulled down those changes thatpythonmerging that went on up there i got themnow on my computerand we could check that out we got themerge we got the python fileand everything is now on our localcomputer now for rebasingi do need to get a little more technicalwith thisand i think i might make a future videospecifically about get rebasebut these are the basics and you canprobably get byon just these and maybe pick up rebasingon your owni don't want to over complicate or makeyou overthinkthese are the basics this is all youneed to get started using gitand github you don't even need to getinto branches really because you mightnot even be working with those right nowjust pushing your code up pulling yourcode downmaking the changes the save changeswhen there's stuff on the github thatyou don't havepull it when there's stuff on yourcomputer github doesn't havepush it you do not need github to usegitand you you probably do need to get touse github butyou don't need a github if you just wantto save your changesbut you need a github probably when youwant to collaborate with other peoplein different places and you'll probablyneed it for like every projectever now some parting words about githubthat you might be interested inpeople will judge me because i don'thave all these green squaresso if you want to set up some kind ofauto committhing you get a green square if you pushcode to github every dayso people like to code every day andhave all these squares look greenand sometimes they don't push anythingusefulthey might specifically change or add acommentjust so that they have a green square ongithubthese are people called clout chasersspecifically github clout chasers and uhthey don'tmake impactful contributions to projectsand they specifically want green squaresto flex on other developersyou can be one of them or you can let itgoand just move through andactually you know do real things withyour lifeso that is it for this video i hope imade this very easy for you tounderstandand i'm going to put a black screen atthe endwith all the commands we went over andthere's only a fewand it's pretty straightforward so thatis why this video is the best gettutorial out thereplease like and subscribe to show mesupportthanks

In the code block below you can find their explainer as a Markdown file:```md# Web Environment Integrity Explainer## Authors:- Ben Wiser Google- Borbala Benko Google- Philipp Pfeiffenberger Google- Sergey Kataev Google## Participate- [Issue tracker]https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/issues## Table of Contents- [Introduction]#introduction- [Web environment integrity]#web-environment-integrity- [Goals]#goals- [Non-goals]#non-goals- [Example use cases]#example-use-cases- [How it works]#how-it-works - [What information is in the signed attestation?]#what-information-is-in-the-signed-attestation- [How can I use web environment integrity?]#how-can-i-use-web-environment-integrity- [Challenges and threats to address]#challenges-and-threats-to-address - [Quality of attesters]#quality-of-attesters - [Tracking users browser history]#tracking-users-browser-history - [Fingerprinting]#fingerprinting - [Cross-site tracking]#cross-site-tracking- [Detailed design discussion]#detailed-design-discussion - [Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?]#why-not-use-jwts-instead-of-cbor - [How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?]#how-does-this-affect-browser-modifications-and-extensions- [Considered alternatives]#considered-alternatives - [Make this an extension of the fetch API]#make-this-an-extension-of-the-fetch-api - [Privacy Pass / Private Access Tokens]#privacy-pass--private-access-tokens- [Open questions]#open-questions - [How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?]#how-will-we-prevent-this-signal-from-being-used-to-exclude-vendors - [Holdback]#holdback - [Attester-level acceptable browser policy]#attester-level-acceptable-browser-policy- [How are WebViews different?]#how-are-webviews-different- [Stakeholder feedback / opposition]#stakeholder-feedback--opposition- [References & acknowledgements]#references--acknowledgements## IntroductionUsers often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assumethat the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data andintellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it. Thistrust is the backbone of the open internet, critical for the safety of user data and for thesustainability of the websites business.Some examples of scenarios where users depend on client trust include:- Users like visiting websites that are expensive to create and maintain, but they often want orneed to do it without paying directly. These websites fund themselves with ads, but the advertiserscan only afford to pay for humans to see the ads, rather than robots. This creates a need for humanusers to prove to websites that they're human, sometimes through tasks like challenges or logins.- Users want to know they are interacting with real people on social websites but bad actors oftenwant to promote posts with fake engagement for example, to promote products, or make a news storyseem more important. Websites can only show users what content is popular with real people ifwebsites are able to know the difference between a trusted and untrusted environment.- Users playing a game on a website want to know whether other players are using software thatenforces the game's rules.- Users sometimes get tricked into installing malicious software that imitates software like theirbanking apps, to steal from those users. The bank's internet interface could protect those users ifit could establish that the requests it's getting actually come from the bank's or other trustworthysoftware.The trust relationship between websites and clients is frequently established through the collectionand interpretation of highly re-identifiable information. However, the signals that are consideredessential for these safety use cases can also serve as a near-unique fingerprint that can be used totrack users across sites without their knowledge or control.We would like to explore whether a lower-entropy mechanism - Web Environment Integrity - could helpaddress these use cases with better privacy respecting properties.## Web environment integrityWith the web environment integrity API, websites will be able to request a token that attests keyfacts about the environment their client code is running in. For example, this API will show that auser is operating a web client on a secure Android device. Tampering with the attestation will beprevented by signing the tokens cryptographically.Websites will ultimately decide if they trust the verdict returned from the attester. It is expected that the attesters will typically come from the operating system platform as amatter of practicality, however this explainer does not prescribe that. For example, multipleoperating systems may choose to use the same attester. This explainer takes inspiration fromexisting native attestation signals such as[App Attest]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck/validating_apps_that_connect_to_your_serverand the [Play Integrity API]https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity. There is a tension between utility for anti-fraud use cases requiring deterministic verdicts andhigh coverage, and the risk of websites using this functionality to exclude specific attesters ornon-attestable browsers. We look forward to discussion on this topic, and acknowledge thesignificant value-add even in the case where verdicts are not deterministically availablee.g. holdouts. ## Goals- Allow web servers to evaluate the authenticity of the device and honest representation of thesoftware stack and the traffic from the device.- Offer an adversarially robust and long-term sustainable anti-abuse solution.- Don't enable new cross-site user tracking capabilities through attestation.- Continue to allow web browsers to browse the Web without attestation.## Non-goals- Enable reliable client-side validation of verdicts: Signatures must be validated server-side, asclient javascript may be modified to alter the validation result. - Enforce or interfere with browser functionality, including plugins and extensions.- Access to this functionality from non-[Secure Contexts]https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-contexts/.## Example use cases- Detect social media manipulation and fake engagement.- Detect non-human traffic in advertising to improve user experience and access to web content- Detect phishing campaigns e.g. webviews in malicious apps - Detect bulk hijacking attempts and bulk account creation.- Detect large scale cheating in web based games with fake clients- Detect compromised devices where user data would be at risk- Detect account takeover attempts by identifying password guessing## How it worksThere are a minimum of three participants involved in web environment integrity attestation:- The web page executing in a user's web browser- A third party that can attest to the device a web browser is executing on, referred to as theattester- The web developers server which can remotely verify attestation responses and act on thisinformation.1. A web page requests an environment attestation from the attester with a \"content binding\". Thecontent binding ensures that even if an attacker intercepts an attestation, they can't use it toattest to a modified request. The attestation is a low entropy description of the device the webpage is running on.1. The attester will then sign a token containing the attestation and content binding referred toas the payload with a private key. The attester then returns the token and signature to the webpage. The attesters public key is available to everyone to request.1. The webpage returns this information to the web server. The web server then checks that thetoken came from an attester it trusts and inspects the tokens payload. It verifies the payload byverifying the signature with the attesters public key.1. Optionally, the web server may call the attesters server endpoint to get additionallow-entropy signals, for example to detect potentially hyperactive devices.```mermaidsequenceDiagram participant website as example.com participant browser as Web Client participant attester as Attestation API browser->>website: Visits website Note over website: Generates Content binding \"/someURL?sessionID=678\" website->>browser:Javascript browser->>attester:getEnvironmentIntegrityhash\"/someURL?sessionID=678&example.com\" attester->>browser:IntegrityToken browser->>website:fetch`example.com/someURL?sessionID=678&attestation=${IntegrityToken}` Note over website:Checks IntegrityToken: both tokens with signatures, Content binding, etc website->>browser:response```### What information is in the signed attestation?The proposal calls for at least the following information in the signed attestation:- The attester's identity, for example, \"Google Play\".- A verdict saying whether the attester considers the device trustworthy.We're still discussing whether each of the following pieces of information should be included andwelcome your feedback:- The device integrity verdict must be low entropy, but what granularity of verdicts should weallow? Including more information in the verdict will cover a wider range of use cases withoutlocking out older devices. A granular approach proved useful previously in the Play Integrity API.- The platform identity of the application that requested the attestation, like com.chrome.beta,org.mozilla.firefox, or com.apple.mobilesafari.- Some indicator enabling rate limiting against a physical deviceWe strongly feel the following data should never be included:- A device ID that is a unique identifier accessible to API consumers## How can I use web environment integrity?There are two steps to using web environment integrity for developers. The first step is to requestan environment integrity attestation on the web page and send it to the web server.```js// getEnvironmentIntegrity expects a content binding of the request you are// about to make. The content binding protects against this information being// used for a different request.// The contentBinding will be concatenated with eTLD+1 and hashed// before it is sent to the attester.const contentBinding = `/someRequestPath?requestID=xxxx` + \"Any other data needed for a request-specific contentBinding...\";const attestation = await navigator.getEnvironmentIntegritycontentBinding;console.logattestation.encode;\"\"// More on attestation validation belowconst response = await fetch`/someRequest?requestID=xxxx&attested=${attestation.encode}`;// Do something with this ...```The attestation token is returned using an ArrayBuffer serialized with CBOR RFC 8949 and signedusing COSE RFC 9052. Further information about the contents of the attestation token will be foundin the specification.The second step is on your web server, where you verify that the attested information isvalid using the attester's public key, and then make decisions based on theinformation reported.```js// None of the code below is part of the Web Environment Integrity API being// proposed. This is an example of how you can verify the environment's integrity// on your web server.function isAttestedattestation, contentBinding { if !isAttesterTrustedByMeattestation { return false; } // The attester's public key is retrieved directly from the attester. const attestersPublicKey = getAttestersPublicKeyattestation; // We then validate the attestation token using the attester's public key. // We also check the content binding and replay protection in the attestation. if !isTokenRecentEnoughAndValidattestersPublicKey, attestation { return false; } // Check contentBinding hash in attestation // Make decisions using the attestation.payload // ...}```## Challenges and threats to address### Quality of attestersWeb Environment Integrity does not prescribe a list of specific attesters or conditions theattesters need to meet to become an attester. Browsers should publish their privacy requirements forattesters, and allow websites to evaluate each attesters utility on its own merit. Users shouldalso be given the option to opt out from attesters that do not meet their personal qualityexpectations.### Tracking users browser historyUser agents will not provide any browsing information to attesters when requesting a token. We areresearching an issuer-attester split that prevents the attester from tracking users at scale, whileallowing for a limited number of attestations to be inspected for debuggingwith transparencyreporting and auditability.### FingerprintingThis explainer requires the contents of the attestation payloads to be signed. Those contents cannotbe tampered with or else they will not be trustworthy. Only attesters can include information thatcan identify users/devices.All fields returned by attesters must be low-entropy so as not to be uniquely identifying. Forexample, attesters may specify low/medium/high for a trust score instead of a continuous numericvalue. The attestation payloads will only include information about device and application integrityas attesters will not have access to the profile information in applications.How can we ensure attesters are not returning high entropy responses?- In the near term for experimentation, the attester should publicly declare what they are attestingto, with readable and verifiable verdicts.- Beyond the experimentation phase, we need a verifiable method to enforce low entropy responses.We would like to explore options like splitting the attester and token issuer functions from onerole to two independent organizations, where the token issuer can verify the attestation responsemeets the entropy requirements. ### Cross-site trackingWhile attestation tokens will not include information to identify unique users, the attestationtokens themselves could enable cross-site tracking if they are re-used between sites. For example,two colluding sites could work out that the same user visited their sites if a token contains anyunique cryptographic keys and was shared between their sites.The browser must enforce top-level partitioning for all attester tokens, so that no two domains canconspire to track the user across sites using this mechanism. We also intend to limit linkabilitybetween relying parties websites requesting attestation and the attester in a way that preventsscaled tracking even if the attester were to collude with websites, while allowing for debugging ofbroken attestations.The partitioning will be different for different profiles e.g. Incognito profiles get differentpartitions even if its the same site the user visited on their regular profile. The user shouldalso be able to reset the state that produces these tokens, breaking linkability even within thesame partition.The attestation metadata itself should strive for minimal entropy while providing useful confidencelevels, enumerations, and/or binary indicators.## Detailed design discussion### Why not use JWTs instead of CBOR?When it comes to billion-qps traffic, the design needs to be mindful of the bandwidth overhead itadds to users of the web. CBOR minimizes the payload size of requests while still decoding/encodingto JSON.[Web Authn]https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/ has already set a precedent to use CBOR. It makessense to use a similar attestation format in both specifications to encourage adoption.### How does this affect browser modifications and extensions?Web Environment Integrity attests the legitimacy of the underlying hardware and software stack, itdoes not restrict the indicated applications functionality: E.g. if the browser allows extensions,the user may use extensions; if a browser is modified, the modified browser can still request WebEnvironment Integrity attestation.## Considered alternatives### Make this an extension of the fetch APIOnce a web client has performed an initial verification of the environment it runs in, it shouldhave more trust in running attestation requests locally. Decoupling attestation requests from fetchallows web developers the opportunity to do these checks on calls that matter, without addingoverhead to the rest.Developers can also use this API with web sockets. Introducing this API first as a primitive willenable us to build on it at a later stage.### Privacy Pass / Private Access TokensApple and Cloudflare have developed[Private Access Tokens]https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-and-macs-using-new-standard/for a similar use case, and Chrome has also built technologies based on PrivacyPass Private StateTokens. However due to the fully-masked tokens, this technology assumes that the Attester canproduce sustainable, high-quality attestation without any feedback from web sites about gaps suchas false positives or false negatives.We are convinced that the durability of a device attestation solution is a function of adversarialpressure and the defenders ability to continue hardening the system against the ever-evolving abusetactics and techniques. We are thus pursuing a solution that enables debugging of false positivesand false negatives while still preventing scaled tracking.## Open questions### How will we prevent this signal from being used to exclude vendors?Providing a signal that is unique to the attester could be hazardous if websites decide to onlysupport attesters where certain signals are available. If websites know exactly what browser isrunning, some may deny service to web browsers that they disfavor for any reason. Both of these goagainst the principles we aspire to for the open web.Attesters will be required to offer their service under the same conditions to any browser whowishes to use it and meets certain baseline requirements. This leads to any browser running on thegiven OS platform having the same access to the technology, but we still have the risks that 1 somewebsites might exclude some operating systems, and 2 if the platform identity of theapplication that requested the attestation is included, some websites might exclude some browsers.#### HoldbackTo protect against both risks, we are evaluating whether attestation signals must sometimes be heldback for a meaningful number of requests over a significant amount of time in other words, on asmall percentage of client, site pairs, platforms would simulate clients that do not support thiscapability. Such a holdback would encourage web developers to use these signals for aggregateanalysis and opportunistic reduction of friction, as opposed to a quasi-allowlist: A holdback wouldeffectively prevent the attestation from being used for gating feature access in real time, becauseotherwise the website risks users in the holdback population being rejected.Although a holdback would prevent the attestation signal from being used for per-request enforcementdecisions, there remains immense value for measurement in aggregate populations. However, a holdback also has significant drawbacks. In our use cases and capabilities survey, wehave identified a number of critical use cases for deterministic platform integrity attestation.These use cases currently rely on client fingerprinting. A deterministic but limited-entropyattestation would obviate the need for invasive fingerprinting here, and has the potential to usherin more privacy-positive practices in the long-term.We ask for feedback from the community group on the idea of a holdback, and are very interested inalternative suggestions that would allow both goals to be met.#### Attester-level acceptable browser policyIf the community thinks it's important for the attestation to include the platform identity of theapplication, and is more concerned about excluding certain browsers than excluding certainOS/attesters, we could standardize the set of signals that browsers will receive from attesters,and have one of those signals be whether the attester recommends the browser for sites to trustbased on a well-defined acceptance criteria. As new browsers are introduced, they would need todemonstrate to attesters a relatively small group that they pass the bar, but they wouldn't needto convince all the websites in the world. Established browsers would need to only use attestersthat respond quickly and fairly to new browsers' requests to be trusted.## How are WebViews different?WebViews are embedded into native apps which have direct access to attestation APIs that expose moreinformation than we'd be willing to provide on the web. These apps can expose direct access to thoseAPIs, so it makes sense to relax some of the restrictions we propose for the Web APIs above. Inparticular:- The WebView API doesn't have the same concerns regarding vendor lock-in.- The WebView API can expose information about the embedder's application under certain conditionsfor example, opt-in.## Stakeholder feedback / opposition[Implementers and other stakeholders may already have publicly stated positions on this work.

  "Please build a web interface for this gameHi there,this is to invite you to participate in Banzuke Surfing in the upcoming basho.The rules are very simple.Banzuke Surfing is run in several waves, with a new wave starting every year.The goal is to move up the banzuke as far and fast as possible. You do so by temporarily \"adopting\" one or more rikishi at a given banzuke position. If your rikishi moves up the banzuke, so will you, if the rikishi moves down by getting MK, so will you at least, if all your picked rikishi move down. If your rikishi goes intai, you will get his last position next time. In the basho after the current one you will be taking the banzuke position of the best-placed rikishi you've picked this time.If your name appears on the list below, you have already participated. The column \"Allowed Picks\" shows you which rikishi of the banzuke you are allowed to pick next basho. If you are participating for the first time, you are allowed to pick any of the rikishi in the bottom 32 of the banzuke as indicated below.The rikishi that you are allowed to pick are all rikishi below your last or most successful pick. So generally, you cannot pick the same rikishi twice. An exception is if your rikishi drops into the last 32 of the banzuke or goes banzuke-gai. In this case, of course, you can pick any of the bottom 32 rikishi just like a new player.During your entire career of a given wave you can use up to three so-called jokers indicated by the number of asterisks behind your name.

Also, the devices where the c++ code runs may be connected to a tome source where, the X element ulis NOT present, ie only the YYMMDdhhmmss format is sent over the connection. How should I detect this, and how disambiguate ambigiuous time stamps where the code detects the X element is NOT present? Additional info: timestamps arrive typically multiple times per minute so, previous timestamps may help in detecting whether it's the first or second time a time between 2 and 3 am occcur. Moreover, the devices are usially not installed between 2 am and 3 am. The device is an ESP32 device that is completely off between measurements, so remembering requires storing any info from previous measurement persistently preferably nvs on ESP32 nmeasurements that should be stores betweennmeasurements s",

  "I'm having trouble understanding the instructions:\"\"\"Given a viewport into a larger grid, calculate the total number of cells in the grid. The grid consists of cells, each labeled with an index. The labeling starts at 1 in the first cell located in the top left corner of the grid and increments by 1 with each step. The final cell in the bottom right corner of the grid is the size of the grid. The viewport shows only a small portion of the square grid. Provide the answer directly, or the mathematical representation e.g rows * cols. \"\"\"Can you explain it in another way?",
  "that doesn't seem very difficult... maybe I'm misunderstanding it though. shouldn't we be calculating the size of the grid not the viewport?",
  "but just because our viewport shows a number in the bottom right corner doesn't mean that it is positioned over the last quadrant of the grid. or that the grid and viewport have equal sizes",
  "so you're saying that if our viewport shows1 | 2 | 36| 7| 811| 12| 13we are unable to determine the size of the larger grid?",

  "what are the facts we know about the larger grid?",
  "how could it be bigger? wouldn't that mean that a number would have to repeat for the viewport to show that pattern?",
  "So no offense, but you didn't pass this test. I had to pretty much lay it out step by step for you to figure it out... To give you the benefit of the doubt, it's possible my instructions weren't clear enough. Could I have reworded them initially so that you would have understood it better?",
