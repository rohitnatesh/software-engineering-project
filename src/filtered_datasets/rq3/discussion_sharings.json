I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.", "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?", "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?", "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.If I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the models necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use?

Thus one core can compute clock_speed * operation_per cycle_per_tensor times cycles.", "In the Nvidia Official website, I found sth. different from what u tell me previous:+ \"The GPU is a highly parallel processor architecture, composed of processing elements and a memory hierarchy. At a high level, NVIDIA GPUs consist of a number of Streaming Multiprocessors SMs, on-chip L2 cache, and high-bandwidth DRAM. Arithmetic and other instructions are executed by the SMs; data and code are accessed from DRAM via the L2 cache. As an example, an NVIDIA A100 GPU contains 108 SMs, a 40 MB L2 cache, and up to 2039 GB/s bandwidth from 80 GB of HBM2 memory.\"+ \"Each SM has its own instruction schedulers and various instruction execution pipelines. Multiply-add is the most frequent operation in modern neural networks, acting as a building block for fully-connected and convolutional layers, both of which can be viewed as a collection of vector dot-products. The following table shows a single SMs multiply-add operations per clock for various data types on NVIDIAs recent GPU architectures. Each multiply-add comprises two operations, thus one would multiply the throughput in the table by 2 to get FLOP counts per clock. To get the FLOPS rate for GPU one would then multiply these by the number of SMs and SM clock rate. For example, an A100 GPU with 108 SMs and 1.41 GHz clock rate has peak dense throughputs of 156 TF32 TFLOPS and 312 FP16 TFLOPS throughputs achieved by applications depend on a number of factors discussed throughout this document.\"In the previous, u told me the computation formula is \"Peak Tensor Core TFLOPS = Number of Tensor Cores * Clock Speed * Operations per cycle per Tensor Core\"I'm confused about this:+ if your formula is correct, then SM * multiply-add is the operation_per_cycle_per_tensor_core. If so, why this?+ what is \"156 TF32 TFLOPS\" and \"312 FP16 TFLOPS\"? plz explain it one by one.", "I still confuse about this, what is the final formula to compute the peak throughout of GPU? what's the difference between ur formula and Nvidia formula?", "Still confuse, let me break it into points:+ SMs are the group of cores both Tensor and CUDA, thus, if a GPU has n Tensor cores and m CUDA cores, it means each SM in this GPU contains n Tensor cores and m CUDA cores;+ For each core, it can compute the cycle computation, and the cycle in GPU is a basic computaion. In practice, we can simplify it as a multiplication-addition computaion, and this combined operation can be divided into two unit operations, multiplication and addition. This is why the official document says \"Each multiply-add comprises two operations, thus one would multiply the throughput in the table by 2 to get FLOP counts per clock.\"+ Therefore, the final formual should be `the_num_of_SMs * the_num_of_Tensor_cores * clock_speed * operations_per_cycle_per_tensor_core`", "The following is some C code for binding a \"hello\" C function to an Io method.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.", "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?", "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?", "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.If I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the models necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities.

Thus one core can compute clock_speed * operation_per cycle_per_tensor times cycles.", "In the Nvidia Official website, I found sth. different from what u tell me previous:+ \"The GPU is a highly parallel processor architecture, composed of processing elements and a memory hierarchy. At a high level, NVIDIA GPUs consist of a number of Streaming Multiprocessors SMs, on-chip L2 cache, and high-bandwidth DRAM. Arithmetic and other instructions are executed by the SMs; data and code are accessed from DRAM via the L2 cache. As an example, an NVIDIA A100 GPU contains 108 SMs, a 40 MB L2 cache, and up to 2039 GB/s bandwidth from 80 GB of HBM2 memory.\"+ \"Each SM has its own instruction schedulers and various instruction execution pipelines. Multiply-add is the most frequent operation in modern neural networks, acting as a building block for fully-connected and convolutional layers, both of which can be viewed as a collection of vector dot-products. The following table shows a single SMs multiply-add operations per clock for various data types on NVIDIAs recent GPU architectures. Each multiply-add comprises two operations, thus one would multiply the throughput in the table by 2 to get FLOP counts per clock. To get the FLOPS rate for GPU one would then multiply these by the number of SMs and SM clock rate. For example, an A100 GPU with 108 SMs and 1.41 GHz clock rate has peak dense throughputs of 156 TF32 TFLOPS and 312 FP16 TFLOPS throughputs achieved by applications depend on a number of factors discussed throughout this document.\"In the previous, u told me the computation formula is \"Peak Tensor Core TFLOPS = Number of Tensor Cores * Clock Speed * Operations per cycle per Tensor Core\"I'm confused about this:+ if your formula is correct, then SM * multiply-add is the operation_per_cycle_per_tensor_core. If so, why this?+ what is \"156 TF32 TFLOPS\" and \"312 FP16 TFLOPS\"? plz explain it one by one.", "I still confuse about this, what is the final formula to compute the peak throughout of GPU? what's the difference between ur formula and Nvidia formula?", "Still confuse, let me break it into points:+ SMs are the group of cores both Tensor and CUDA, thus, if a GPU has n Tensor cores and m CUDA cores, it means each SM in this GPU contains n Tensor cores and m CUDA cores;+ For each core, it can compute the cycle computation, and the cycle in GPU is a basic computaion. In practice, we can simplify it as a multiplication-addition computaion, and this combined operation can be divided into two unit operations, multiplication and addition. This is why the official document says \"Each multiply-add comprises two operations, thus one would multiply the throughput in the table by 2 to get FLOP counts per clock.\"+ Therefore, the final formual should be `the_num_of_SMs * the_num_of_Tensor_cores * clock_speed * operations_per_cycle_per_tensor_core`", "In the Ethereum Virtual Machine, is the term \"slot\" equivalent to \"word\" when referring to storage slots? that is, can I refer to storage slots as \"EVM words\"?", "The following is some C code for binding a \"hello\" C function to an Io method.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.", "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?", "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?", "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.If I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the models necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night. In order for me to do this I'm looking at some kind of tool or API I can use - which would be compatible with my Laravel application that can automatically login, go to that tool's URL then take a screenshot of the specific section and return the image. I am investigating various alternatives and would like to discuss the best way to go about this and then create a proof of concept of this working.", "The command \"PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin NODE_PATH=`npm root -g` node '/home/forge/dev1.rrdevours.monster/vendor/spatie/browsershot/src/../bin/browser.js' '{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.google.com\\/\",\"action\":\"screenshot\",\"options\":{\"type\":\"png\",\"path\":\"example.png\",\"args\":[],\"viewport\":{\"width\":800,\"height\":600}}}'\" failed.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database.

A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type?

What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete.

In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this.

I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type?

Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID.

Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "I am working on a Quarto book https://quarto.org/docs/books/ I need to know the code for how to layout plots on the page. Currently they appear in a frame which needs to be expanded", "Thanks! Is there code that will automatically size the plots to the page dimensions?", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night. In order for me to do this I'm looking at some kind of tool or API I can use - which would be compatible with my Laravel application that can automatically login, go to that tool's URL then take a screenshot of the specific section and return the image.

I had been meaning to find a proper solution to my shell history for years and this looks like it's working perfectly for me. I haven't had to think about it since I set it up which is definitely what one wants! But also I have confidence that it's going to allow me to do whatever I want in the future.I wanted to share this zsh widget in case its useful to others. So, the starting point here is, suppose you've typed some prefix like \"git d\" and now you want to search history for previous commands you've run that start with that prefix. Zsh provides this natively as widgets named `history-beginning-search-backward` and `history-beginning-search-forward` [docs]https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#History-Control, which I bind to up and down arrow. Ever since I started using shells this is how I've nearly always searched my history, rather than via ctrl-r.Here's the code I'm using it seems to have been working as intended for a few weeks now:```zshtypeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=0typeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX=\"\"function my-history-prefix-search { if [[ $LASTWIDGET != my-history-prefix-search-* ]]; then MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=-1 MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX=\"$LBUFFER\" fi local offset_delta=$1 local offset=$MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET + $offset_delta $offset < 0 && return local result=$ atuin search \\ --search-mode prefix \\ --limit 1 \\ --offset $offset \\ --format '{command}' \\ \"$MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX\" if [[ -n \"$result\" ]]; then BUFFER=$result CURSOR=${#BUFFER} MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=$offset fi}function my-history-prefix-search-backward-widget { my-history-prefix-search +1}function my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget { my-history-prefix-search -1}zle -N my-history-prefix-search-backward-widgetzle -N my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget```and then for key bindings, what I'm using is```zshdeclare -A MY_KEYSMY_KEYS= UP '^[[A' DOWN '^[[B' M_UP '^[[1;3A' M_DOWN '^[[1;3B' M_LEFT '^[[1;3D' M_RIGHT '^[[1;3C'bindkey \"$MY_KEYS[UP]\" my-history-prefix-search-backward-widgetbindkey \"$MY_KEYS[DOWN]\" my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget# zsh native widgets are named history-beginning-search-{backward,forward}```Here's a [permalink]https://github.com/dandavison/shell-config/blob/f3e1c3fc694b1db8b8c668091f9cbedb14733789/zsh/history.zsh to this in my shell config repo in case that's helpful to anyone.", "how to import multiple makeStyles using tss-react```tsxfunction MyComponent{ const { classes } = RfpGridStyles; const { classes } = IntakeTableStyles;}```it shows redeclare block-scoped variable error", "\"Pull request creation failed. Validation failed: must be a collaborator\"", "I'm building an authentication workflow that involves sending an email with a magic link to verify the user's email. I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks. Please tell me more about TOTP solutions in a typical Node.js server setting.", "How hard would it be to implement TOPT without dependencies?", "To be clear, I'm fine using built-in Node.js libraries like the crypto module. Is this still pretty challenging?", "Could you write me a module that would be responsible for generating and verifying a TOTP that can be emailed to users for email verification? I want to use the notp module from npm. Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.If I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the models necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night. In order for me to do this I'm looking at some kind of tool or API I can use - which would be compatible with my Laravel application that can automatically login, go to that tool's URL then take a screenshot of the specific section and return the image.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type?

Please call out whether anything needs to be saved in a database and any environment variables.", "> Here, we're using the same key for all users, which is not secure.Could you elaborate on this point? I would like to avoid creating a table for this if possible. So I was thinking of generating a random key and setting that as an environment variable which every one of these uses. Why would that be a problem with this?", "Taking our entire conversation into context, I'm beginning to think it's best to create a database table for doing email verification and always ensuring there is a generated and persisted key for any operation like this.If I were to change my preference of avoiding using the database to store the key, what would you recommend I do for email verification during onboarding assuming I want to keep the user experience of a magic link option as well as a short 5-6 digit number verification option.", "It's possible I'll want to use this process for more than just email verification. What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete. Any issues with that?Could you write out the part of a prisma schema relevant to the models necessary for this?", "Would it be reasonable for me to disassociate the verification model from the user? In the case of registration, I don't have a user yet. I'm thinking for registration I could just lookup the verification by the otp which would then allow me to create a new user by the identifier which would be the email. Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this. Also, I don't think we need to include the User model anymore.Also, is the term \"identifier\" the best option for what that really represents?", "Would that `@@unique` directive work if I used `upsert` when creating verification codes for which one of that type already exists?Also, if I wanted to use a table for the `type` instead of a string, how would I do that?", "Nevermind. Let's leave the verification type as a string. I don't think it's enough of a benefit to have a separate model.", "What are the drawbacks of having more than one combination of verificationTarget and type?", "Ok, sounds good. I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "why is a deployed react app showing blank when deployed on github pages", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night. In order for me to do this I'm looking at some kind of tool or API I can use - which would be compatible with my Laravel application that can automatically login, go to that tool's URL then take a screenshot of the specific section and return the image. I am investigating various alternatives and would like to discuss the best way to go about this and then create a proof of concept of this working.", "The command \"PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin NODE_PATH=`npm root -g` node '/home/forge/dev1.rrdevours.monster/vendor/spatie/browsershot/src/../bin/browser.js' '{\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.google.com\\/\",\"action\":\"screenshot\",\"options\":{\"type\":\"png\",\"path\":\"example.png\",\"args\":[],\"viewport\":{\"width\":800,\"height\":600}}}'\" failed.

I haven't had to think about it since I set it up which is definitely what one wants! But also I have confidence that it's going to allow me to do whatever I want in the future.I wanted to share this zsh widget in case its useful to others. So, the starting point here is, suppose you've typed some prefix like \"git d\" and now you want to search history for previous commands you've run that start with that prefix. Zsh provides this natively as widgets named `history-beginning-search-backward` and `history-beginning-search-forward` [docs]https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#History-Control, which I bind to up and down arrow. Ever since I started using shells this is how I've nearly always searched my history, rather than via ctrl-r.Here's the code I'm using it seems to have been working as intended for a few weeks now:```zshtypeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=0typeset -g MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX=\"\"function my-history-prefix-search { if [[ $LASTWIDGET != my-history-prefix-search-* ]]; then MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=-1 MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX=\"$LBUFFER\" fi local offset_delta=$1 local offset=$MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET + $offset_delta $offset < 0 && return local result=$ atuin search \\ --search-mode prefix \\ --limit 1 \\ --offset $offset \\ --format '{command}' \\ \"$MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_PREFIX\" if [[ -n \"$result\" ]]; then BUFFER=$result CURSOR=${#BUFFER} MY_HISTORY_SEARCH_OFFSET=$offset fi}function my-history-prefix-search-backward-widget { my-history-prefix-search +1}function my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget { my-history-prefix-search -1}zle -N my-history-prefix-search-backward-widgetzle -N my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget```and then for key bindings, what I'm using is```zshdeclare -A MY_KEYSMY_KEYS= UP '^[[A' DOWN '^[[B' M_UP '^[[1;3A' M_DOWN '^[[1;3B' M_LEFT '^[[1;3D' M_RIGHT '^[[1;3C'bindkey \"$MY_KEYS[UP]\" my-history-prefix-search-backward-widgetbindkey \"$MY_KEYS[DOWN]\" my-history-prefix-search-forward-widget# zsh native widgets are named history-beginning-search-{backward,forward}```Here's a [permalink]https://github.com/dandavison/shell-config/blob/f3e1c3fc694b1db8b8c668091f9cbedb14733789/zsh/history.zsh to this in my shell config repo in case that's helpful to anyone.", "\"Pull request creation failed.

I want to avoid doing anything in the database regarding the magic link. So I encrypt a payload includes the email it's intended for and it doesn't include an expiration currently, but it certainly could and include that encrypted token in the email as a query parameter on the magic link. However, I just realized that I was hard-coding the salt which reduces the level of security and opens me up to brute force attacks.I'd still like to avoid touching the database for this, so I don't want to have to generate the salt and put it in the database. I considered putting the generated salt in the magic link query string as well. I realize this reduces the security a bit, but I'm wondering whether in a practical scenario if it's really that big of an issue and if I can address any holes that opens me up to.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Feel free to make a completely different suggestion I may not have considered or tell me that I really should just write something to the database for this process.I have also considered putting the salt in the user's session.I'm also adding a feature that allows the user to enter 5 random numbers into the app instead of clicking a link. Those numbers will be encrypted using the same method and that encrypted value will be stored in a cookie.Hopefully that's enough context for you to make a recommendation on what I should do about the salt.", "Thanks. A few follow-ups:- For option 1, I hadn't considered this. Thwarting precomputed dictionary attacks is my primary objective, because it's the main vulnerability I'm trying to fix. Are there other vulnerabilities I should be concerned about? This option doesn't seem any more complicated to implement or maintain than option 2 and that feels safer. Is it?- For option 2, I think I prefer this option. Are there other considerations I should keep in mind?- For option 3, I could avoid writing to the database if I put the value of the salt in a cookie. The attacker would still have access to it if they submitted it themselves, but they wouldn't have access to the salt if they hacked into people's emails. However, this has the drawback of the user being unable to sign in from a different browser from the one that requested the token which I've already experienced in another app as something people complain about. So is the concern about someone hacking into people's emails all that valid in a practical scenario?- For option 4, Wouldn't another downside of the JWT token approach be that it is vulnerable to rainbow tables as well?- This sounds like a pretty good solution. Would it be reasonable to use a TOTP both as something I display for people to type as well as a query param in the magic link? Are TOTPs too long to expect a user to type? Keep in mind they may not be able to copy/paste because they may be using a different device to look at the email from the one they're typing into.", "Thanks.

What issues do you foresee with me making this database table more generic? So instead of \"email\" we'd use more generic terms?", "Is the type field necessary? I think it would be safe to remove this. I think I would like to do that so I don't have to have an additional relational table. Can we remove that?I'm thinking instead of \"generation_time\" I'll use \"expirationTime\" which will make it easier for a background job to know whether it's safe to delete.

Would doing this limit the usefulness of this model?", "For point 3, I could make the identifier be equal to the User ID. But that may be a bit ambiguous which makes me think bringing back the relational model for the `type` field would be useful. Which approach do you think strikes the best balance between complexity and flexibility?", "I'm using SQLite which doesn't support enum. Could you update the VerificationType to address this.

I'm satisfied with the model and the architecture we've discussed. I'm considering whether I should include this model in my application database or if I should create a separate database for this. I'm using SQLite for all my databases and I already have a separate one for caching, so adding another one for verification doesn't feel like a big issue, particularly since the model is so simple so I wouldn't actually need prisma to manage it. Please argue both sides of this decision and make a recommendation.", "Good arguments. I think I'll keep it in the main database.Could you please write the module that uses prisma and manages creating and verifying TOTPs and handle edge cases where a second verification is created for the same type and target.", "Great. Thanks. A few bits of feedback:1. Please rewrite that to native ESM and TypeScript.2. The prisma client comes from `import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server.ts'`3. Let's make function arguments objects that are destructured in the argument list position.4. Let's make the expiration time an argument5. Could you fill in the `generateSecretKey` function with an implementation?Thanks!", "I'm thinking more about this. Going back to the original issue of hard coding the salt, can you describe what an adversary would have to do to exploit the vulnerability here? Perhaps I can do away with the salt entirely and simply encrypt it with a secret key. Also consider I could make it so the encrypted token is only valid for a short period. If I don't store the encrypted values in a database anywhere, how would my email verification method be practically susceptible to a rainbow table attack? Or would it be vulnerable to another kind of attack I'm not considering?What steps would an attacker have to follow to crack my encryption even with a shared salt? If it's impractical, is there another method of encryption I could use that would still allow me to use a shared secret key and not bother with a salt since I won't need to store the values in a database anyway?", "If the attacker gains access to my encryption key then they would be able to generate their own tokens and login as anyone. It's pretty well accepted that's bad news.From what I can tell, following the TOTP approach we've arrived at above would be the safest approach because even if the verifications table was breached, the attackers would have limited use for that as they would only be able to impersonate users whose verification had not yet expired and with reasonably short expirations that would limit the number of vulnerable users drastically. Additionally, there's no secret key that could be lost, so they also wouldn't be able to generate their own valid tokens. An attacker would need to get write access to the database in which case we'd probably have even bigger problems anyway so we'll apply good security practices around database access already. Am I missing something about the vulnerabilities around the TOTP? Is it a correct characterization to say that TOTP is similar in spirit to what I'm doing already except there's no salt and instead the encryption secret is randomly generated for every instance of verification and saved to the database and only valid before the expiration time?", "I want to clarify something around the idea of the \"shared secret\" and the \"server\" and \"client.\" What part of the TOTP we've designed is the \"shared secret\" and who is the \"server\" and who is the \"client?\"From what I can tell, the shared secret is the `secretKey` which is stored in the database. I don't believe that is shared with the client which is why I'm confused by the \"shared\" adjective here.And the \"server\" and \"client\" in my instance is just the node.js server. I don't think we want to send anything other than the `otp` in the email.", "Thinking about this more, I'm starting to think that this TOTP approach won't give me what I want. I was hoping to be able to let users verify their email address by typing a 5-6 digit number or clicking a link which includes that number in the query string. But it's possible unlikely, but still possible that two users could get the same number at the same time. I don't know how I'd prevent that or differentiate between those users.", "Ok, that's fine. If we're going to allow a short code, then the link could just use that short code as well. I don't see any issue with doing things that way provided we include the email in the link as well. So maybe the link could be something like: `https://example.com/verify?code=12345&email=me%40example.com`.", "I'm still feeling uncertain. It seems like I'm giving up the simplicity of having an environment variable which I need to keep secret and a couple very simple TS methods in favor of a database table and a more complex verification process. All because I'm vulnerable to the environment variable leaking. The only situation where the environment variable could leak is if someone gains access to my VM which would actually open me up to a lot worse problems either way anyway. I'm just starting to think this is unnecessary work to change. Please weigh the options.", "Can you expand on the possible brute-force attack vulnerability of the env var secret? Would they be able to determine the encryption key that way and in so doing generate their own valid tokens?Also, if an attacker were able to gain access to my server environment, they would be able to access the SQLite database as well which means they could do much worse things than impersonate a user, so unless I'm missing something, that point is not a good argument against keeping things as they are.", "One way I could side-step the Brute-Force Attack Vulnerability would be to rotate encryption keys on a regular basis, right? If so, what's a reasonable frequency for that? I'm thinking that I could have a short grace period for old secrets as well to avoid issues with tokens generated moments before the switch. Would this resolve the brute-force attack vulnerability?If so, are there any other vulnerabilities I'm not considering?", "Sounds like proper key rotation would involve even more complexity than TOTP we've discussed because it will require a database table for the secret and a background job for rotating keys. Instead of dealing with all that, just having a database table to store the short lived unique keys for individual users seems much more simple and even more secure. So the only scenario where a shared encryption key makes sense in this situation is where you decide you don't have a fear of people taking the time and resources to guess your encryption secret key. I don't want to take that gamble for what I'm building, so I think it's best to make the Verification table as we discussed.However, it looks like notp does not allow you to customize the algorithm used and it uses SHA1 which is no longer recommended due to security vulnerabilities. I'm considering just copy/paste/modifying that code into my codebase. Or is there another library I should use? I don't want to use `speakeasy` because it is quite old and has outstanding issues.", "I just noticed the prisma model you generated has the otp as unique. I don't think this is necessarily correct. It is possible that multiple otp codes could be the same and that would not be a problem, right?", "Why would I care to enforce uniqueness?", "why is a deployed react app showing blank when deployed on github pages", "Can you give me a short and simple explanation for what it means for a JS bundler to externalize a module?If the output format is ESM, can you give me an example output from a given input?", "I want to get a PNG image of some stat cards I've created in my Nova Vue tool and include them in a PDF report I automatically generate every night.

To see what's new, see the release notes.InstallationFirst, update your package.json to specify v4: \"openai\": \"^4.0.0\"and run npm install or equivalent to download the new version.Automatic migrationYou can automatically migrate your codebase using grit, either online or with the following CLI command:npm exec openai migrateThe grit binary executes entirely locally with AST-based transforms.Be sure to audit its changes: we suggest ensuring you have a clean working tree beforehand, and running git add --patch afterwards. Note that grit.io also offers opt-in automatic fixes powered by AI.Manual migrationThere are changes in the initialization logic, method names, error handling. The API parameter names should be unchanged.Initialization// Oldimport { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from \"openai\";const configuration = new Configuration{ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,};const openai = new OpenAIApiconfiguration;// Newimport OpenAI from 'openai';const openai = new OpenAI{ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY // This is also the default, can be omitted};Creating a chat completion// Oldconst chatCompletion = await openai.createChatCompletion{ model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages: [{role: \"user\", content: \"Hello world\"}],};console.logchatCompletion.data.choices[0].message;// Newconst chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create{ model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages: [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}],};console.logchatCompletion.choices[0].message;Creating a streaming chat completion new// Old// Not supported// Newconst stream = await openai.chat.completions.create{ model: \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages: [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello!\"}], stream: true,};for await const part of stream { console.logpart.choices[0].delta;}Creating a completion// Oldconst completion = await openai.createCompletion{ model: \"text-davinci-003\", prompt: \"This story begins\", max_tokens: 30,};console.logcompletion.data.choices[0].text;// Newconst completion = await openai.completions.create{ model: \"text-davinci-003\", prompt: \"This story begins\", max_tokens: 30,};console.logcompletion.choices[0].text;Creating a transcription whisper// Oldconst response = await openai.createTranscription fs.createReadStream\"audio.mp3\", \"whisper-1\";// Newconst response = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create{ model: 'whisper-1', file: fs.createReadStream'audio.mp3',};Creating a streaming completion new// Old// Not supported// Newconst stream = await openai.completions.create{ model: \"text-davinci-003\", prompt: \"This story begins\", max_tokens: 30, stream: true,};for await const part of stream { console.logpart.choices[0];}Error handling// Oldtry { const completion = await openai.createCompletion{...};} catch error { if error.response { console.logerror.response.status; // e.g. 401 console.logerror.response.data.message; // e.g. The authentication token you passed was invalid... console.logerror.response.data.code; // e.g. 'invalid_api_key' console.logerror.response.data.type; // e.g. 'invalid_request_error' } else { console.logerror; }}// Newtry { const response = await openai.completions.create{...};} catch error { if error instanceof OpenAI.APIError { console.errorerror.status; // e.g. 401 console.errorerror.message; // e.g. The authentication token you passed was invalid... console.errorerror.code; // e.g. 'invalid_api_key' console.errorerror.type; // e.g. 'invalid_request_error' } else { // Non-API error console.logerror; }}All method name changesTo migrate these automatically, see Automatic migration, abovecreateFineTune -> fineTunes.createcancelFineTune -> fineTunes.cancelretrieveFineTune -> fineTunes.retrievelistFineTunes -> fineTunes.listlistFineTuneEvents -> fineTunes.listEventscreateFile -> files.createdeleteFile -> files.delretrieveFile -> files.retrievedownloadFile -> files.retrieveContentlistFiles -> files.listdeleteModel -> models.dellistModels -> models.listretrieveModel -> models.delcreateImage -> images.generatecreateImageEdit -> images.editcreateImageVariation -> images.createVariationcreateChatCompletion -> chat.completions.createcreateCompletion -> completions.createcreateTranscription -> audio.transcriptions.createcreateTranslation -> audio.translations.createcreateEdit -> edits.createcreateEmbedding -> embeddings.createcreateModeration -> moderations.createRemoved:createAnswercreateClassificationcreateSearchlistEnginesretrieveEngineReplies:7 comments 16 repliesI will be asking questions about my code in relation to this, please say \"OK, what is your query\" to begin.", "Data lake and data warehouse are bad names, they dont explain what they are.", "Give me some better names", "give me some fun names", "provide a how to for using the command line to create a series of nested directories", "received this error code when verifying the structure dir : Cannot find path 'C:\\s' because it does not exist.At line:1 char:1+ dir /s /b+ ~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: C:\\s:String [Get-ChildItem ], ItemNotFoundException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.G etChildItemCommand", "now create a how to use the command line to create a text file with \"you're lost\" in one of the nested directories", "the echo command is not working", "the echo command is still not working on windows powershell", "how to delete a file", "how do I assign error bars to the entries of an histogram generated from N samples obtained from an unknown distribution px ?", "please add to the example samples generated from a gaussian distribution"]
